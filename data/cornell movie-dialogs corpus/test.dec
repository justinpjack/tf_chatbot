Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
You always been this selfish?
What crap?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
I hope so.
Hi, Joey.
What do you think?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Why?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Perm?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Yeah -- we'll see.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
You get the girl.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Do what?
We don't chat.
We're not.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
Just a little.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
Who cares?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
My mission in life.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Who?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
You know what they say
I'm gettin' there
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
How?
No what?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
What?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
So what I want doesn't matter?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
What?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
Good enough.
Just for now.
With the teeth of your zipper?
See you next week!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I am busy inside.
Yes... I remember...
This time with me!
... for a commoner?
Call them.
You never learned how to speak my language.
Damn God!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
What did they say about Granada before today?
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
He must be replaced.
Where are we going?
You bring the cigarettes?
I was all of these.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
Right.
Pouring it out!
Go on.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Yeah, right.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
Describe him.
Watch the news?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Pretty.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
Stay here.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
There are two bodies found at this point.
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You're ruthless.
Could be Leon's.
Answer the phone.
Tonight.
Yeah.  I promise.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Not what.  Who.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
How long are you planning to stay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
You said speak Czech!
Shut up.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
Good idea!
Cut!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
He's my collar!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Clean?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay, come on down.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
No.
Yes.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
The antenna has to be replaced.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
She's in the bathroom.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
I see.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
True.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Opening pod bay doors.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
How about chargin' the battery?
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I ain't tired yet.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
You have a good time?
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
What are you talkin' about?
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
Not likely, convict.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Don't worry about it.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
That's the way I see it, too.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Jack, wait...
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Shut up.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
You noticed...
So you do know her.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Yes..thank God..
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Perfect.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
They are... with me...
In your dreams! See you tonight!
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Have you pulled yourself together?
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Crystal.
I don't think this is a good time...
Not without Leeloo.
Where have I heard this song before?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
All 900.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Exactly.
Uh..
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
Why the gun?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I just talked to her.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Dino...
What can I do for you today?
And they are?
Machine.
Right here.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Move it, dirtbag... !
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
I don't know...
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah.
Tell me what happened.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
That's right.
Never mind how I found you.
They're no friends of mine.
Shut up.
Yeah... guess so.
I'll risk it.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Sounds good, pops.
Interesting theory.
Child pornography.
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
My condolences.
I'm afraid I don't...
No.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Okay, I follow you so far...
You're joking.
I'm here.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
How will I get it to you?
Neil... Neil Cole.
You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat.  Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh?  And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her.
I don't know.
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
We're all like that.
No.
What?
Will you let me look?
Who is this... ?
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
I don't want to.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Kristen...
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
Let me talk to you.
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
I told you you can't help.  This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
Don't worry, honey
Huh?
Been having bad dreams.
She doesn't want me around
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
No.  A deal's a deal.
Since my little girl became a mom...
I've got to go.
But Dad --
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
My baby!
I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
Makes you look like a nun--
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
- any more than being the son of Captain Neilsen does!
Let's get back to work, and maybe we <u>will</u> be, soon.
The sound again?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Yes, Griff?
Wonderful!
Radiation level...constantly rising...
Who with?
Point of view is everything. To us, <u>your</u> form of life is ugly as we appear to you.
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Same old shit.
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
Good. It would help if there were some drug or alcohol abuse on the part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems upsetting to the child.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
That was me.
Yeah?
Hmm.
What happened?
Shit.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Yeah.
Break stuff?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
I called Mommy.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
Yes.
Yes.
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
It belongs to Pop.
Nothing.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing anymore.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I'm not saying that.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
Yeah. A few things.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
For a while.
Yeah.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I got waylaid. Sorry.
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
This town sucks.
A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
How was she?
No thanks. I don't drink.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Well, I never heard that one.
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
I'm sure he's busy.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Daddy...
Alice... I...
Been better, Dad... You?
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
To swear you in as President.
About goddamn time.
Yes
Good. Good.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
That isn't necessary.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Flying the plane.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
We're under attack.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
Commissioner.
I just wish it was that simple.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Te...!
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, please be careful.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Compute!
I mean for Ted.
Simon.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Sure.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
Don't try to stop me!
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Then Elaine was right.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
That's right.
No.
Ted!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Uh-huh.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Yes, Captain?
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Lay off, asshole.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
But I-- .
Screw me?  That can't be right.
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Why?
Thank you.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
We can't let him get away.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Ss'kya'ta'.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
The human?
Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
Yeah, I'll bet.
It is. 
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Bullshit!
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
The structure seems intact.  They have power.
Sir?
...We're coming in.
Sure, Hicks.
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Let's waste him.  No offense.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
We ain't going anywhere.
Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
Hey...hey!  Look, Crowe and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
Uh, what's next?
Think of what?  We're fucked.
Seal the door.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
No.. I've slept enough.
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
I know, honey.  Me too.
At present the girls only peck me. Their cruelty surely will wreck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown! At present the girls only peck me. But one little beak in my own, And I'll up to heaven be flown. Up to heaven be flown! Up to heaven be flown!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
What?
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Yes!
Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway.
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
What?
Eat
Well, don't do that again!
Don't be stupid.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
Stanzi!
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Oh, Stanzi.
No one.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
Yes.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What for?
But! I'm a married woman!
Not at all.
He's doing his best.
Hey!
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Michael!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Yes?
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Of course not.
No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Ah, love again.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Well. There it is.
He's here.
Am I not welcome?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
They say you're in debt.
It's a secret.
This is just a game, Papa.
Good morning, sir.
Really? What is it he's writing?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I don't know. He has pains.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
Animals?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Do you mean that?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Come. Let's begin.
What time?
I think so.
Please! Just one moment.
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Exactly.
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Mozart -
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
And do they believe it?
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
I did.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Yes?
Incredible.
Yes, in the third act.
Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Yes, Doctor.
He said 'Jack'.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Warn him?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Is David acting strangely?
Yes, Doctor.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Will you give me a break?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I dream of death mostly.
Twenty-eight.
I know.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
There is only one bed.
Do me an enormous favor?
I'm freezing.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Jack is dead!
David, don't lose control.
No.
No.
No.
Has he been refusing food?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
You could have told them!
What are you going to see?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Yes.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
You ask them.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Yeah?
Pecos Bill.
Yeah.
Plan?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Walk away, Jack.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Stop it, Jack.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Yes.
Hi, David.
How shall I do it?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
And what, Sergeant?
Yes - sure\97
Yeah.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Yeah?
Aw, nerts!
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
I haven't got it.
Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
What is?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
My apartment.
Good for you. Come on.
Yes, sir.
John, how's your wife this morning?
Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Yes, sir.
Numbers? No, never mind.
Oh, no! It's not for you. You're only going to get married. Mrs. Dickson and I are going to go on the honeymoon.
Yes?
Yes, thank you.
Why, I don't know.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
You're protecting somebody.
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
But I haven't . . .
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir.
Come here, honey!
Yeah.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
All right, dear.
Mr. Williams . . .
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
Yes, sir.
What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
Huh?
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Tom, I'm this close to coming with you...
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Never a good thing.
What?
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
He's not bad at it.
Nope.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
He's been full of vinegar lately.
No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
I could use the walk.
She got two of them.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Sure, cousin.
Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
A trap.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
I'm thinking...
Both would be nice.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
They gonna rush us?
Of course!  Uh, sir?
The District Marshall
So?
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
No, I --
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Yeah Jimmy?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Nuh-huh ...
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
You didn't want to farm?
And what's this right girl like?
Sparkling rocks?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Hmm" what?
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
I'll explain on the way.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Fair enough.
Thank you.
I guess so.
I think so.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy.
I just though you were awful cute.
Really?
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
How much did they get from the safe?
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
THEN WHO DID?!
So you can't tell me anything?
I can't believe this.
I demand action.
In English, Pinkerton.
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Oh God, just get it over with.
Yes?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
Evelyn?
Everybody's rich.
Everybody has a great body now.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Yes, I am.
Oh God, I can't believe this.
I know her. I knew her.
How did you guess?
You saw the ad in the Times?
There was no ad in the Times.
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
It's just not.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there.
Maybe it's just the light.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Oh really? That's great.
Yes, sir.
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Yes, Patrick?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
Sorry. 
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
Jean-I'm not-
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
What do you think I do?
No. Flattering, but no.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin\E9e of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you.
No.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
Well...
What do you mean...Yale thing?
No. Not really.
No, he just hung out there.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
Wait. That's not what I've got.
That's not the information I've received.
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
And?
But Marcus denied it?
So who was he with?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
Al.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
Oh well, you know.
Yeah, well, you're late.
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
"Make" him?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
I know, I know.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
...Why?
Milo --
I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
Just shut up?
You're just afraid to eat it.
Prick.
He wasn't acting?
...It's -- Milo, isn't it?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
Would you like a Coke or something?
Skywire.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Talk about work? Never!
The wrong place?
...Worse?
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
You do?
Cool.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
She saved my life.
No, no. Never.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Before they kill somebody else, too.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
That's lame, isn't it?
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Let's try #2.
Uh. Not exactly.
Jesus, Teddy.
I met this girl.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
I didn't plan this.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hey, how are you?
Smashing!
Good luck, Austin.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
What's the other?
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Yes Basil?
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Here, use mine.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism.
How do you know?
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Yes.
Shut up.
Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Blow me.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
... head ...
Love...
... power ...
Promised? Who promised?
Sir August...?  What now?
Mr. John Steed, please.
Really -- what happened in 1922?
If nature gives a man a collector's mind, it doesn't matter what he collects. Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings. A true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
This isn't a game.
Rules are made to be broken.
Then who wins?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Ring?
One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
1922. Why the kippers?
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
Do you really think so?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
Any other vices?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Very good, Steed ...
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Nothing personal.
Always.  Except ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Where are you going?
It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel.
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated.  Wait here.
I know all this.
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I shall need a small plane.
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
Guilty until proven innocent?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Where?
Both, actually.
This way ...
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
I was at Harrow ...
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
When do the girls get to the party?
I'm marrying Debbie.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
The best.
She's mine!
Mr. Thomerson.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir, I am.
But how can I do that?
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Yes, sir.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
You better not have too much joy.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Great, Mom.
I hope those guys are all right.
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
A real turd.
Any time, Al.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Screw that.
I'll take some.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
All right, who serves?
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Rick!
I'm separated.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
I'm saved. Let's party!
You got it.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I don't know.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
-- You know what Swayzak would do to the department if this got out? --
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Thanks for the insight.
Just leave me alone, okay?
-- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
Saw what?
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
Shut up!
Jennifer.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
So now you suddenly care about my future?
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Got anything to drink in there?
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
Yes.
I don't have the slightest idea...
It's a small town.
Then who --
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
What are you listening to?
What?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Yeah? Airtight?
Yeah.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Nice boat.
Ah man, is he usin' that line now on you? What, you think he made that little gem up? Jesus Christ, I used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning.
Management were pin heads.
I was ahead of my time.
And DIE!
Cute.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
He's got piano lessons.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
Why?
Nah...
"The Strawberries"?
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Why? Jesus! Why me? Why can't I wash the ashes from my forehead, year after year after year? And why am I still drunk on your blood, the taste of your flesh on my tongue? Worst of all, why can't I feel the nails in my palms, the spear in my side, the crown of thorns round my head? Why do I have to know, over and over, that it was you. You who died; died for my sins! And that I will die for nothing. Why?
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B-L-A-K it is.
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
Ho!
Yeah!
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Delacroix.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
You might be right.
She's also moorish.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
Different.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
We're starving.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance.
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
Calm down, please.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
It's me, Peerless.
Pleased to meet you.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Always keep 'em laughing.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Your father is proud of you.
Manray!
Do you know how you will use him?
Good.  I'm going to need your support.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
Hello.
Break a leg.
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
I don't believe it.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Oh her.
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
You slept too near where you got in?
Never read a book in my whole life.
Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
Just ask me what you want to know.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Old fool!
Agreed.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
The Prince left him only that choice.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes, of course.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
And he doesn't care about me?
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
We found him like this --
We don't know. West is dead.
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
He's lying.
And the bodies?
Epilepsy.
Would you have believed me?
Can't do that now, though, can you?
How do you know that?
Why?
West... he's dead.
West's. Any kindling for afire?
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Look in my pack.
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Put it down!
But you didn't.
Well?
I didn't --
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
Well, he's a good soldier.
And the problem is you only got three.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Who killed Pike?
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Why?
I plan to grow on you.
So noted.
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
That's gonna stay my secret.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
The faggot speaks.
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Fifty minutes.
You can't threaten me --
Childs.
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
Toughens us up, Pike. You don't like it, quit.
Bullshit --
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
Sir, yes, sir!
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated hypertension.  How would his son describe him?
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole life. Never really known why.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Really.
So how does it happen?
Okay.
I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
The river?
Like this.
Story of my life.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
There is no softer ground than town.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
I'll help you.
Mmm, what?
We rented a car.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
But I understand you, Mom. I always have.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
What for?
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
No I haven't.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Good night.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well as it turns out I did.
I know you just want to punish me --
So you're just going to be vindictive
What?
Have you got your passport?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
But, you know, so what?
You don't want to talk about it.
You don't have to say anything
She's dead.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
What was her name?
It's alright.
It's not mine either.
Tell me about it.
Maybe you will find out.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Thanks.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Can I come in?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Yeah.
Sure.
She's around. Always is.
You been home yet?
Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Better'n me?
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
Why you got me chained?
The fuck you been doin' to me?
In my house, you watch that lip...
Whose doin' is that?
Itches.
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
I'm here with you.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
By myself?
Why you say that?
Nuh-uh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
I didn't start this, R.L.
THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT? THIS IS HOW YOU HANDLING IT?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae don't do this now...
You feelin' sick?
Yeah, I do.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Ronnie...
Got in a little accident.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Charlie...
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Where is the subway station, please.
Go to sleep, Charlie.
I didn't know.
Let's grab some food.
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
What'd she say?
What does Charlie mean?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
I don't, that's all.
They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
There she is!
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
We're through.  I mean it.  This is the end of the line, Matsumoto.
I want to yank Kobo.
A resort city, Beppu.
No.
Kampai.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
A wife.  She left.
Yes...
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
There was a change in plans.
You could fake it.
You met her.
Who am I supposed to be?
Tell them I'm not.
I'm taking you back.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Then take it from him.
This by this...
Yeah.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
I have to get to Sugai.
The families who control the casinos?
I'll pay you.
He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
Not to be trapped.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Can the maker repair what he makes?
Had in mind something a little more radical.
Come here.
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Thank you.
Hello, glad to meet you.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
You didn't like her!?
Yeah.
She's not with you?
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
I think we're through for the night.
And what in your estimation works?
I gotta piss.
Four years.
I'm taking a piss.
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
What did she want?
I don't know nothing about it.
For holes.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
It would be my child.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Not too good.
If they are smart, they take naps.
Like?
Good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  Part of your education.
Because it's not.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Thirteen.
Don't move.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
A tortoise.  What's that?
I never seen a turtle.
You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
I don't have one.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
Thanks.
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
How do you do?
Come where?
Oh, brother...
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
You don't?
Perry?
Oh, I could die...
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
How long would you need me?
Name it.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
What for?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Two weeks.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Good-bye!
No way.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Thanks.
Is that what you call it?
Yes, Eve?
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
I promise. Is that all?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
1959.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
I just don't want to.
No.
Almost all of them.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
What?
Just look!!
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Hi.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I never know anymore.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
The locks.
No.
I'm not hungry.
What?
Honey?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Yes...
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Amen.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I knew you'd like him.
Oh, yes.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I think...it...works.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Uh..he might of.
Yes, you do.
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
You're goddamn right I am!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
What?!
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
It must be great.
The criminals are winning.
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
No, not at all.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Yeah.
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No.
I'll go then.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard.
No, please. I won't.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh?
That's good.
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Do you love me?
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. Are you?
No.  Hi baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Speak to me Fucker.
There ya go.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
That sounds great!
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Where are they?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
Why not?
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Oh, okay, can I call?
Are you sure?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah.
What is it?
I can't dance fast.
Frank!!!
No Jeffrey!!
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
I can't find the second one, sir.
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
I-I'll tip her.
Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
Connor, is that you?
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We paid attention in school.
Our mother can see through bags.
Right.
How many?
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
No pictures, either.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
Aye.
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
A-fuckin'-men!
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
How do you figure?
Rocco!
You... oh god, why?
Pee...Per...Man.
It was... It was...
Really want to know?
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
No way they could have seen it?
What?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Twist of lemon!
Sweet-n-low!
Shit! Shit!
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
You sure you killed them?
So?
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
You know them personally?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
God have mercy on my soul.
How long since your last confession, my son?
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
Eight dollars.
We know there's another stocker.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
I don't like to use that credit card, Dignan.
Because my mom gets the bill.
Look at the treads on those.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
Hi.
Sure.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Bob?
We said 48 hours.
This morning.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I know.
How much?
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Ah. Couple days ago.
That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let me feel that.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
I don't think you will.
He was all right.
As a person?
Yes. I do.
Good. It's supposed to be.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
Can't remember shit. CRS.
We haven't heard from Applejack since he got out of the hospital. His case got dismissed.
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
Dignan, I --
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
So do I.
I don't want to die.
No. Bob did.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
I hope not.
Move.
Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
Cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
Cuba.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
That's your domain.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Don't count it.
I don't want to talk about it.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
It's registered in my mother's name.
We'll have to see when we get back.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
I never agreed to that.
That's OK.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I'm working on it.
Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
26 weeks.
Yes.
Well, I think --
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Well, I left some money in there.
No. I just have short hair.
You Hoto?
What?
Pleasure to meet you, John.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
Did he say anything to you?
No good options left?
It was staged?
Okay... 
You're a liar.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I can't let you do that either.
-- my coat -- but we should --
No. There's nothing new.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
There must be another way!
But you found another choice.
You do?
I killed him???
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
No. You never worked Berlin.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Sounds like a threat.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Is there. Is all there.
Who's this?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
You mean, did I want a date?
Are we hacking or asking?
And what about you, anything?
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
It was in Latin, sir.
Saying goodbye in their own way -- in outlawed tartans, with outlawed pipes, playing outlawed tunes.
We must sue for peace.
We cannot defeat this --
That is another matter. There is a price to all this, required both by Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, and you will be our king. And we will have peace.
The Scots will fight for us?
You fancy him.
Hamish, I... thank...
Fourteen? --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We've lived a dream together. A dream of freedom!
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
How many?
I could crush you like a roach.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
...Tonight!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
I am trying.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
What is it?
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
How soon?...
Can't he come out for one day?
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
Something must've happened! What set him off?
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
How long will I be in here?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Fix?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Not in this wing, actually. No.
Yes.
I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
But I... I need those books.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
Damn. Your dad did this?
He must be. They're letting him go, right?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
What do you want to know, Evan?
It was a long time ago.
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
What?
He's a fucking maniac!
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Calm down, kid. Stand still.
...yes.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
Evan Treborn.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
I'm sorry.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
I came with Captain Renault.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
It's not for sale.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Well, so long.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
You needn't be concerned about me.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Has it got a wow finish?
Richard, I had to see you.
Please.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
No.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Won't you join us?
Goodnight.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
He suggested I ask you.
-- Yes?
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
You're saying this only to make me go.
Go ahead.
What of it?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I said, ask your wife.
Thank you.
You love her that much?
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Yes.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
I expected no less, Captain.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Why two?
He'll take one.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
-- Thanks. I will.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
You think of everything, don't you?
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Our expenses?
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
I never make plans that far ahead.
What is your nationality?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Worse than Warsaw.
Going to die anyway.
Take it.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
As much as anybody.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Sure.
Had a package to deliver.
I've got lots of time.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Let me guess, Russia came up?
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I thought you might have.
I would have done the same thing.
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
No.
Yeah.
Sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  Going to pass beef.  Chicken's global.  No religious taboos.  You don't see your Hindus and your Muslims boycotting poultry.
Mom, meet Jango.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Want to see my raft?
Hallelujah.
Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
What?
Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
Deep, real deep.
No sweat.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Better than I can!
I know.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
Really?
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't...
She knows how to take care of herself.
Sure. Thanks.
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Well, they aren't.
I know what you've been doing.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
No. She was an immigrant.
Is that soon?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Migrants?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
Okay...
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Yes, for both.
In other words, scurvy.
You do it then.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
So what?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
That's it.
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
And these cops? What do they get?
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
The cash we fleeced off of him was collection money. He was supposed to take that money and give it to the King earlier yesterday like he does every Thursday. 'Cept this time, he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the King's money back before any body says "boo."
So what? We hide, right?
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Yes, her. Where's my wallet?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
I'd like this cashed, please.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Because you killed one of my crew.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
No thanks. I'm good.
Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
You get an equal cut.
Why?
Uh-huh.
You guys got busted. This is a great neck.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
What about what?
No, I want my cut!
It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
But the best part was that he couldn't find Gordo! He was in the bathroom. So he finally goes in there, kicks in a stall door and starts yelling! And there's Gordo, pants at the ankles, holding a PC World Magazine!
Jake? Customs?
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
I'm sorry.
No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I can handle it.
It's not history.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
A Fed? Is he close?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
We're here.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
No. Thanks.
Maybe another time.
It's the tension.
I can imagine.
I despise the job.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
I want a job, Giles.
Who was he?
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
Fine.
Tension. It'll go.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What about a drink on the way home?
I'm on at nine.
Leave it.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
Then what?
I want to buy a car.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Robbery's not criminal?
What about my neck?
What for?
Do you?
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Over the river.
Thanks.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Rough life, Jack.
No.
I was at Beadles.
We check every four days.
What for?
No.
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
Right, that checks out here.
Oh. What's wrong now?
I hope it's not the oven again.
Eventual supernova.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
Energy shielding positive function.
Huh?
Hey, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Which one?
Any of 'em any good?
What?
Who cares?
-- Remark.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
Yeah?
Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
No.
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
They took my daughter.
Mommy, where are you?
Mommy, I'm scared.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Hardly...
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Zack... He made it... He's alive...
Any idea when she'll be back?
I'll wait.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Oh?
You're also a fool.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
You and me both.
Got a pencil?
Straight.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
I have sincere eyes.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Tell everybody hey.
We gotta talk.
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Max--
I'm the victim here.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
I'll give it my best shot.
He's sick.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Gin.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Got any KISS?
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
Yeah?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
You got in the car, didn't you?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
What's in Sandusky?
Plenty, but it was all bad.
Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs.
YO, DOOFUS!
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Damn straight we are.
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Sure.
The easy way.
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
Go ahead, Jam.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Not if I shoot first!
GOOD MORNING!
Yeah.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
What did you say?
You'll know soon enough.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Why is that?
Why?
With, like, images?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
What?
Are you okay?
The whole movie. Let's go.
What's wrong with you?
But you're OK?
It's safe here.
Why? Is this about the book?
Yeah...
Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
Do they know yet?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
I know, Dad.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
The good stuff.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
But you were punished.
What else makes you feel regret?
You've done it again?
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Her name is Gretchen.
Okay, but it has to be a small one.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
What I think is going on with your son.
It is a big deal.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
She's alive, sweetie.
Yeah, you betcha...
Really?
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
What?!
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Here, have some.
Yes, Leslie!
You could be quiet.
Oh, naw. Hi.
"Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
My dress'll reek.
Yeah.
Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
I wonder how she's gonna fix that one.
Oh, all right  How soon they forget where all this comes from.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
Gladys! Stop it!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Uh, Gladys?
Enid ate a whole pan!
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
The king can do no wrong! 
"My President"...
Send for my car...
Take a letter...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I don't want him.
He only weighs ten ounces --
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I can't do it...
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Not at all.  When I was a boy back on the farm I used to pump my own water.
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Go ahead.
I don't remember.
You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
The king can do no wrong!
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
This is terrible!
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Yes?
Shut up!
What do you mean?
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Good morning, sir.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
I don't understand.
I could easily arrange...
I feel much better. Thank you.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
I don't know what I've got.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Oh no?
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Righteousness...
Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you.
You did not ask me.
That's a canopy, John.
How is your tea, John?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Yes, very soon.
Fine.
Yes! The workhouse!
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Handsomely?... Who sent you?
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
There IS no one.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
What are what?
Put them down!  PLEASE make them put them down.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
And the week before that?
But, Erik...
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
Goodbye, Aud...
The second note to wake the Gods...
Not quite...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
It was my master Keitel's idea.
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I'm sure it's lovely.
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Why... should YOU care?
I don't know! I just did!
He was lucky...  Sit there.
Come on, move it!
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
I know. I know.
Sorry!
What "magic"?
So?
Now stop it!
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Like fish.
Oh... er... yes...
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
Keitel Blacksmith?
How about making friends?
What is it?
I will join my grandfather there.
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
The Dragon...
Do what?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Hang on...
I... I...
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
You can't let Erik do THAT.
Help!
I know, Dad.
I must only let the red rage...
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Dad!
Yes, Mum.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
You did? You liked me?
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
In the room?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Why?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Yes?
That's okay.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
What?
Very much.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
No, I'm okay for now.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I know a man who needs a refill.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Thanks.
That's scary sounding.
Okay.
I want to have a baby.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
You're not ready.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
I love it!
Naomi, I guess.
Egad, were you horrified?
Hi.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Make love?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Says you were a bully...
I can't stop thinking about you.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Your dried cum.
Hi.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
Maybe if I just explain what happened, I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
It's not somebody else.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hi.
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Yes?
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Oh dear.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
It's a quote book.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Save your breath for the climb.
Siwash, huh?
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Well.... er...
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Yep.
I'm the best.
Your ranch?
A job for me?
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Justin?
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
I'm telling you, I saw it...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
"Another man?" Who?
Hear what?
What happened?
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
His peritoneum has ruptured...
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
Starck!
That's the Second Containment Seal. Beyond that, engineering.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
The crew? Could they still be alive?
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
...how's the client?
Do it.
Justin.
Where has it been for the last seven years?
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Captain Miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
Negative.
It's complicated...
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
Yes...
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
What makes you think I'll miss?
I'm not the Devil.
You're lying...!
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Love to.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Justin?
Come around to three-three-four...
But you can breathe it.
How much oh-two do we have?
What is it, Starck?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
I did.
Not according to the computer.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
All boards are green, everything's five by five.
How?
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Yes.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
I'm alright. Please.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I like the sound of that.
What is this? Where's Reed?
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
And you can? Power it up?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
He's made a few changes.
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
Ben. Are you okay?
Got it, teach.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
'Course not. Strictly business.
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Go back to the drawing board.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Not this again --
You've been working out.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Right, whatever, have fun.
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Girl...?!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Showtime.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Never better.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What...?  Oh.
And reverse the mutations --
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
Why didn't you say something?
You need a doctor.
Sure.
Reed, we're running out of time.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Just find him.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Totally.
No. I want my money back right now.
See that sign? It says 100% Money Back Guarantee. Do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do they teach you that here? Give me my money back.
Sis.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Well... it's true.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
No.
Yes, sir.
Get a ride with somebody.
He's my friend, too.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Damone, you gotta listen to me.
No.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
So what makes you so sensitive?
They're fuckin' with us.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Do you think that guy's cute?
What should I do?
I know.
What variables?
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Climax together.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
That little prick.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
That's the name they gave me.
Yes.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
All right! Oh, yeah!
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Do you really have to go?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
Not for me.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
Dobermans don't talk.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Jesus! Did I say that?
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Lacerda?
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there...
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport.
Plans?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
It's gone too far.
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Right!
Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
Of course, officer.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
You and a lot of other people.
Whatever you say, gentlemen. I can't tell you how sorry I am about what happened...
Spare me.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Her fella.
Where's that?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
And the rest of 'em?
Hey!
Easy.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Fuck you too.
No. You?
Just an observation.
We lived near power lines.
We gotta try.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed.
Seven.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
No bullshit.
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Duh hickey.
Gimme the keys.
What?
If he doesn't shut up...
HELLLPPP!
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Nothing, just lookin'.
She's not very nice, is she?
Not without you!!!
Well...
I just hit it like you said.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
Thank you --
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
My clothes?
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm not!
Who is she?
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Right now we have to be practical.
Sort of.
No?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I know you believe that.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No. Never.
And you think it's worth all this?
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
Thank you.
Good.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Fifteen.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
...Not if I can help it.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
What?
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Yeah.
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
I took the early rounds.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Oh Harry...
Why do you say that?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
What'd you do?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Yes, Ma.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Why are these all opened?
Where are you going?
Not long.
Yes, Mama.
Mama...?
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
I'm going out!
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
Yes. It was very good to see her.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
No! No!
What?
You drove him to his torment.
Better that way... for me.
Materials. Nothing more.
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's not for you.
There, there... shhh...
Quite right!
And you look so lovely.
Aren't you?
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I wish to be your husband.
Your decision. For us.
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It wouldn't dare.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Victor, Victor Frankenstein.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
No. He had more important work.
That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Thank you, Henry.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Let it go.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
The strain was evident.
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
I will protect you.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Good night, Brenda.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Okay.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I meant everything.
I had to.
Is it stuck?
Get behind him more.
That was the telephone.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Lead the way!
Mmmmmmmph.
Umhummmmph.
There you are dead wrong.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Jacob.
He's my son.
Sorry, I need everybody.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Yes.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Well, you just keep thinkin' of that gun next to Kate's temple.
Pass.
I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
No!
Not many.
You use 'em on the first couple of these parasites that try to bite you.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Six-fifty.
I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
You can't come in here.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
She's in the other room.
What?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
What?
Where are you right now?
Yeah, it's mine.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Thank you, sir.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Didn't take long.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
No, sir.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
I don't see how, O'Neil.  Dismissed.
Sir?  What did he say?
Sir...
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
Sounds familiar.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
I'm sure it is.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
Sir?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Just like you would be.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
What?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Thanks, Wick.
They had to kill 'em?
Sure, sure.
Smoke it!
Maybe half.  Not even.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
North?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
The E-Ringers?  Full integration is gonna cost the services billions at the worst possible time -- when Congress is already swinging the axe.
I don't know.  Seems...
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
Sure. I'd like that.
How do you know?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
What's it to you?
Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.
Oh, I'm not married.
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
That is when we will go in.
Have them sealed off.
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
Sounds like a big company.
Oh.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
You were right.
How do I do that?
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm... I'm shot.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
The guy is terminally selfish!
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
Oh can't I? Watch me!
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
Nobody was WATCHING?
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
What's  your name, son?
Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!...
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
Hey, YOU want to drive?
You smiled at me.
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
Only answers to me.
On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
I don't think that's a cloud...
Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
Why does this sound so familiar?
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Gwen...
Mark 12.
You are so full of shit
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Catch me later, okay?
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
Well... Sort of...
It doesn't have eyes.
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores!
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
But trust you to do what?  One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money.  But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans?
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
While they're strung out?
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
You go too far, Benedict.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Well, general, I think I ain't got no school learning, I ain't got no trade... and I'm a drunk.  So, I think there ain't much left to be set free.
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
And is that the most horrible thing in the world?
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
We better, Congress invented him.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
To hell with Arnold...
I'm not sure.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
What's the difference?
George!  So good to be back!
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
General Lee, sir!
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
My God, what?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally?  What with all the rumors getting back to England.  I thought she might inquire after us.  But then I believe she always looked down on us.
I think I heard that.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
I want you to see our hospital.
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You know very well who it is that I love.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
I'd throw everything away for you.
Africa, of course.
Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
That's good... who?
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.
Juba was a Numidian.
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Farrah. Come here.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
You're right.
I have to ask you for that key.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
You can talk to me.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
Who?
That's all.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
I don't believe this.
What?
I can't do it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
That's the magic number.
Okay. So who are you?
Or else use your fucking imagination.
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
The shylock's the good guy.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
But you work for the casino?
Who's the star?
Never say anything unless you have to.
His shrink's trainer.
Hey, Harry.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Ask your man here.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Good-looking, too.  Like Karen.
I'm up twelve grand today.
Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
You broke in?
What if it was?
How much is the wife offered?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
Depends, who pays?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Hey, Chili? Look at me.
What happened?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet, for Christ's sake.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
That's where you got the idea?
Shylock?
'It' didn't slip away, Martin, you did... when you went off to fuck Nicki in the middle of my birthday party.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey \96-  This your ride, Chili?
And after all, you have such morals.
A passenger liner. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
With that coxswain dickhead.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
Smugglers maybe.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
Yeah, yeah.
Warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
Right.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
Don't lie to me!
Conveniently enough for you.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
I bet you did.
I feel fine.
Better than starving to death.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
But, who -- ?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Not our mystery guest again.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Go.
You got that right.
Looks like it's adrift.
Sorry.
You're up late.
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
And look what happened.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
I guess.
I just buzzed him in.
But I can't --
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Well, yes...
What do you mean?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
Hi.
Then why do you hate me so much?
That's just the way I am!
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
We should follow them!
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Oh yeah.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
Totally! Look!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
What, is she black now?
What are you talking about?
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
No way... when?
He does that every single day.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Don't worry.
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, I guess... call me...
What are you talking about? Who?
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Nothing.
Great...
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
Shhh!
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
Norman.
Yes.
Well why do I care about that?
God, fuck you!
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Watch my stuff.
NO!!!
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
Just wait here.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Hooray for me.
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
Hi, it's me...
Really?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
In whatever way you think I mean.
I had to see you.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What?
What do you want?
I-I-I...
You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
It's a tampon in a teacup...
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
That slut!
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Yes he is.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
We have hunted since childhood.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Have you got that in writing? 
Does he speak English?
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
You mean nobody died?
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
Thank you, Samuel.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
Okay, that's no problem.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Good-bye, Peter.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Don't worry.  Janine has a very special way with children.
Finally came to your senses, huh?
Same difference.
A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
Ghostbusters.
The Upper West Side.
Command me, lord.
-- the sorrow --
Yes.
Get on with it, counselor!
Did I forget something?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Hello, Venkman.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
It's an interesting one, Pete.  If anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
It's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Okay, but you're missing all the fun.
Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
The whole city's together on this one.  We took a vote.  Everybody's down on you, you know.
Ungrateful little Yuppie larvae.  After all we did for this city.
Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
No, I just thought --
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Oh yeah?  Anytime, anytime.  Just go ahead and try it.
I don't think he's ready for the toaster.
And decent.
Miss Blue Blood?  Her family's been here since the year 12.
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Thanks.  What's in there?
I told you, I ...
Out!
I'll scream.
Goodbye.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
I want you inside me.
Really!  Is it gone?
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Talk to my accountant. 
We'll get back to you.
Print is dead.
Die in what sense?
What is it?
Has this ever happened before?
In a storage facility.
Yes, it would.
Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Yeah, I can smell it.
What?
Why not?
What do you mean "bad?"
What is it?
Neutronize.  System shut.
That appears to be the case.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
What do we do now?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
Yes?  Go on!
Not yet, dear brother...
Gladly Caesar.
Do we really need to repair this fort?  It seems like an expensive undertaking.  I propose we burn it to the ground.  That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position.
You flatter me, Caesar.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
You're hearing about somebody else.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Yours will do!
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Let him trust Quintus.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
Chain him.
Don't be ridiculous.
What the hell are you talking about, Greek?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Hello.
No, I couldn't.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Yes.
No.
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
GET OUT!
Come in.
Did you say rape her?
You've got to tell me what she said.
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I have to go back now.
I'll think about it.
Why wouldn't it?
Carl who?
Yes, sir.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
Yes.
I'm in the bathroom.
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
No.
What?
What?
What?
So?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Will you unzip my dress?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Get away from that door.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Waiter!
What?
Well -- I don't know.
I'll be up in five minutes.
The number.
Why don't you watch?
What?
What?
You're welcome.
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
Are you tired of it?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
He's asleep.
What?
We don't.
No we don't.
Not exactly.
I don't.
Is it?
No.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Not particularly.
What?
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
That's enough.
But why shouldn't I?
Then let's hear them.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
You wouldn't.
If that's how you feel --
You don't have to say that.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Sure.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I do.
About an hour ago.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
You'll never be young again.
Thank you.
Oh no.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
They are?  Come on.
Rejoice in life while yet the small lamp burns.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
The pearls are in her room.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Not with strangers.
No -- why? -- should I?
Free --
For tonight. 
Yes -- oh!
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
Am I quite strange to you?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Yes -- I do understand.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I know.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
Bless you --
A little strange, Baron.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
How's the beautiful lady?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I did not ask your advice.
Don't do that. 
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought. 
No, doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
Stay where you are.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Movies?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Perhaps. 
What?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Hello!
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
I understand perfectly.
A thousand marks -- 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
I wish to be alone.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
There was -- there was.
But when did he go? How do you know?
I don't know you.
Me?
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
Bobo, no, I --
You'll never shit right again.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
I will. So long, Bobo.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Can't move.
It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Every once in a while, a major change comes through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes in.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
These machines -- They're in here.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
But what's wrong?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
I'll get you a check.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I guess I owe you my life.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
That's right.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
No.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
In your other hand.
Taking you for granite?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
You called the doctor, huh?
Oh, don't be stupid.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Yeah? How?
What happened to Cole?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Open your door.
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
That don't match either of the victim's.
Only the real stiffs.
Charming.
Care to join me?
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
Toni Blake from Langley P.D.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
And miss the big game?  No way.
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
No.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Nothing.
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Yes.
No.
That would work.
You stole it?
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
I came to see you.
I'm okay.
Okay... thank you.
Who?!
What?
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
What is it?
He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Why?  You interested?
You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
Who are you?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Here.  Let me try.
Or what's left of him.
This is madness, Wynn.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Oh, shit.
After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
Go home!
That's the point!  Walk in there and find whatever there is to find--before Alice can cover it up.
Really?
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
Maybe it's time you got out.
You.
If what?
The posies are for her?
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
I just want one true adventure before I die.
You're making a joke.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!  Out!
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Do you mind if I ask who you are?
Is anybody besides you here now?
Where's Mom?
I'll see.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Uck.
Mhravitch.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
I can't take my eyes off you.
Damn.
The smallest thing I've got.
Leave a tip.
Who was it?
No.
It's your house, Dad.
I'm talking to you gently now.
Heaven.
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Daughter--I love you very much.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Give us time.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Shouldn't you lie down?
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
Scrambled eggs, kippered herring, fried potatoes--and a whole onion. I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
No you're not!
Sneaking in the back door.
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
No.
Load it for her.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
He's dead, you know.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And her fianc\E9!
I've literally got to run!
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
What a brilliant diagnosis!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Chills, fevers, sweats.  You can describe it and name it after yourself: "the Woodly galloping crud."
I've never heard of it.
Correct.
You haven't heard me yet.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
My violin is avenged!
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
I've enjoyed being man.
Get up.
It's trash now, like mine.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
I dunno.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
That is sad.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Who have you been talking to?
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Then get him.
You're taking Mom out tonight?
Oh?
Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
How nice.
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
How long has this been going on?
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
And maybe Paul.  What about the murderers?  They're in there!
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Not true.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
It's good.  Let him go.
Then we'd stay home and eat venison or something, and look through the scrapbooks.  I've got a friend who has a whole freezer full of striped bass and caribou meat.  I'm going to bring that boy back.
Yes, we do.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
There's something wrong here. Kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Pull out your cock.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
How many weeks?
Okay.
Yeah.
That's all you got, three girls?
Sam?
Yeah. How did you know?
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Do you know where she would be?
Three hundred?
Ulcers.
No.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
But it's all you do.
On your own land?
But what?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Where is he?
That's right.
And better?
Yeah.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What are you paying me for?
What have you found out?
Like what?
Just leave me alone.
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where does he hang out?
Well...
Okay.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
No.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
...I'd just start my own business. That's what I did. Get into kid porn. That's big now. Why don't you come around the set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I'll ask around.
He asked me. You going with anybody?
Well, a boy goes like this, see.
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
To anybody.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, I don't have one.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
No, no. I just took it.
Is this your shovel?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Then whose name is it registered in?
Wait here.
Lady! Be quiet.
I'm a file clerk.
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create ... Verily these issues lie in the lap of the gods... Iliad... Just sit down for a minute.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Eh, no.
Promise?
Eh, fine.
Yes. Very much.
Certainly a new experience for me.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
It is kind of rough.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Superb.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Yes.
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Maude.
Here.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Can't complain.
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Does that worry you?
Why?
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
I go to funerals.
Well, maybe one.
No.
Yes.
To pit your own life against another.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
ZAT!
Eh?
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
She certainly has.
Sorry, friend. No day trips to Hell. Here you are. Here you stay. And forward the only way to go.
God, that's terrible.
If anyone can help, HE can.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Finish what?
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
The Cenobites.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Story of my life.
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
What is it?
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
No. It was red. Bright red.
I think that is its hand.
He's just going through a phase --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
Anung-un-Rama...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Father's back?  Still angry?
Yes?
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Hostage negotiations.
Not hungry.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Two steps back, please.
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Not much.
Sure.
It'll go in.
Uh-huh.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Who are you?
Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
You did this before, right?
You can keep them.
I have to speak to my father.
This isn't happening.
Poor baby.
That's right. Who are you?
Oh.  Oh yes.
I don't want to see the dress.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
Keep your voice down.
A box?
What kind of doors?
You're still afraid.
So you were cheated.
I don't.
Maybe.
There's very little I can do about it.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I saw everything.
No. I'm not.
Oh Christ. Julia...
I'm here.
Can I get you anything?
Kirsty.
What's wrong with you?
Don't go upstairs.
He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery --
Just soda.
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
I prefer the floor.
Maybe I will.
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Steve.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
Call me tomorrow.
You like?
Surprise.
Never better. You sleep well.
So lie down.
We walk.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Oh no.
What happened to you?
'Bye.
I don't know.
That's right.  Kevin.  She's Mrs. Kevin Bannister.  She lives in Australia.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
What's next?
But now I kind of like it.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
What the fuck is that?
What band?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
No.  We need the gig.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
That's what we want.  Reaction.  And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em.  Let 'em riot, we can handle it.  We'll be ready.
On Clark Street!
So.  Is now a good time?
What's his name?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Yeah.
You look upset.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
We won't leave it, Ian.  Not ever.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I should be so lucky.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Just the obvious stuff.
No.
Just ask it!
Is what better?  Better than what?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
You don't ever think about other people?
That bad, eh?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Those aren't mine.
I can't talk right now.
Pig died.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Okay.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Okay.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
You're tougher.
I'm alright.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Not really.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Everything all right?
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
No, we...
I'm Vince.
Nice.
Sure.
It's my birthday.
No thank you, I'm fine.
I don't follow you.
The boy _died_?
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
That bothers you?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
Have you gone to the police?
You are.  Now.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
Not all of them.
They do it each year.
Yes.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
Why are you here?
He knows about you.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
Is that a threat?
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
No!
Now there's a new topic.
You and I should talk first.
You're an asshole, Moran.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Never take up poker, Detective.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Please go to no trouble.
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Pheasant.
Why are you here?
You're a long way from Inverness.
You know me home.  Me name.
Yes.  Always.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Me arm hurts.
Muy Bien!
It's like to kill me first.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
Far away.
So sure?
We need more time.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Second musketeer.
If you wish to play games, Major.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
I had no choice.
Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
I don't know.
Sit.
You were never a kid.
You're insane.
Not so long.
This isn't done.  Get up.
And if I refuse?
Do you?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Same.
No.
Just your pappy scared some.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
It doesn't have to rhyme!
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Yes, wasn't it?
The Criminal Courts Building.
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
We'll explain the whole thing to them. 
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
Oh.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
The money? Why?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
No, you don't!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Out of the mouths of babes.
What?!!
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You -- you --
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Please! Will you just --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
The insurance business?
Thank you.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Hold on a minute.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Where's Bruce?
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Walter, you can't do that!
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
You got plenty of money?
What?
They can't do that to me!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
What have you got, Hildy?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
So long, Hildy.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
An attempt to ruin us!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I did.  Hold the wire.
What?
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I was just going to!
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Go on -- shoot me!
I'm telling you!
What did you do with her?
Phone for you, Hildy.
I'll go right after it.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
Put down that gun, Earl.
Don't move!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Quiet, Mollie!
I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Who do you think!
No, I don't think so.
It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Come on, fellas.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
I give that marriage six months.
No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
But Grandpa, you said...
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
I only know one.
Won't they have maps?
Could.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and four and five...
...and six...
The sodding water table.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
Jam.
Fair enough.  The river.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
Out.
There, there, my baby.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Up to six weeks, I think.
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
Huh... what cone?
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Oh yeah, the tree.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Nice.
I was just wondering.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Shit, I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
OK, Boss.
How awesome?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
He won't move.
Man, it's already ten thirty.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
I gotta open the gate.
Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Grab Mary and come inside.
I don't want to see that.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
That seems likely.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I don't know, I think he's funny.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
What do they call you, sweety?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
No, just a little too old.
Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Right.
I always favored the Hulk.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
That must be him.
Excuse me for a second.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
When you were a little French girl?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Shh.
Stop. Get away.
Unnhh.
I just want to talk.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
No. You look so beautiful.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know. Something's missing.
But I like being human now.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
What do you mean?
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Three foot one.
Nathan told my brother.
Shut up, you.
You've got to respect that.
Where?
How's it going?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Nathan!
I don't think so.  Why?
Of course.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I think he's feral.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Your entire body?
I have to think! I have to think!
Of course not.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Sure. Of course.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
Oh boy!
Ummm. It's good.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Yes.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Oook. Oook.
It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Yes?
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
You know what's good for him?
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
How?
All I want's the money.
You ever played billiards before?
Cash.
I lost twenty bucks.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why?
For who?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Hi. How's business?
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Aaaahhhh!
You well-heeled, partner?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Yeah. Just like that.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
How much?
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
Okay?
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Yes.
What bus?
Fair.
I used to be an actress.
I drink.
Give me a drag.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
At school. It's Thursday.
Thanks.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
I've got something in my bag.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
You wanna drink?
What's it so hot in here for?
Is that what makes a winner?
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
He went off someplace.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
You watch me.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
With them?
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
Have you always had it?
Yes.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yes.
Please.
Round back.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
If we want it, it is.
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
Was there anything over the hill?
What, Jim, what?
I was so scared.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
Why, yes.  Why?
I'd believe him.
'Cause he wouldn't lie.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Hide the car.
I know a way.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What happened to your other slipper?
What? -- I... 
The back door was open.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
Why, yes.
All right.  I'll be right back.
If we do, we'll both die virgins. But at last we'll be together.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He's a good man.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
We've tried. It's not working. It's almost as though they weren't even there.
College nickname.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
But Mr. President...
She should be shortly.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
Roger.
No Sir. Definitely not.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
We should leave too.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Yes.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
Many worlds...
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
And I am his.
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
It's war.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
In that case, I permit you.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Look, can we discuss this later?
What???
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Head for the fireplace!
I'm out, Dad!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Thanks.
It happens to me all the time.
You call this archaeology?
Junior...
Penitent. Penitent...
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
My soul is prepared. How's yours?
No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Yes, I understand.
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Why they glow like that?
Behind you!
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Hey, he's not a waiter...
Relax, I've been giving him lessons.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Oh yeah?
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
I know the feeling...
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
She might get away with that act here, but she'd never make it in a real nightclub.
Maybe he likes older women.
I've never been so hungry in my life...
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Willie!
They think I'm insane. Tell them I'm not, Indy. Please -- help me ...
I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
I know you did!
Al ???!!!
Yes.
Yes.
Where are we?
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
I just went there for a job.
You said it.
Yep.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
You're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...We'll have to do it on our own.
You gotta help.
What does it say.
Just scratched my arm, why?
What am I supposed to do?
You are in trouble. Now do it.
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
The sand.
Why not?
Where are you going? Wait!
What was?
Try another language.
Don't just stand there, say something.
No...you idiot!
To the hotel. To register.
Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her.
Rene...
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
You have no taste.
Who, me?
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just hold them close and stay still.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
What if she says something important?
Joe! It's 56 hours!
No. What will you do.
Osaka?
Just stay here and rest.
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
A hard left. A hard left.
Aim what?
...Shit! It's just money.
GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho.
Yeah, sure.
Aren't we all.
It'll remind me of you.
Dieter?
Rene?
Who's our little man?
I dyed it. We're all getting old.
**?!! 
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
He work for us?
I have a new client.
Yes. Joe.
You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
What?
Thanks.
Well what?
Here?
Oh.
I feel fine.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been hearing voices.
Yessir...very good sir.
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
Disinterest?
How often they come here?
What do you mean?
No.
Food doesn't agree with me.
I'm just on vacation.
How do you know you can trust me?
Oh sure.
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
You can say that again. What do we do?
It was my choice.
Why did you, then?
I've never met anyone like you.
You're gonna laugh.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
I know a nice island.
Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it?
Tear it apart?
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Yes.
Poor bastard.
Okay.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
What's that outside, Daddy?
In the backyard.
Lowell?
I'll be there.
Monday.
Yeah. Catch you later.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish?
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Hey, Lowell.
What about you, you got a crew already?
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay.  Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
What's the difference...
Who's calling?
Did you say Berman?
"60 Minutes"?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Jeffrey...
I'll call you then.
That's right...
Okay. Thank you.
You eating with us?
What do you mean?
Good.
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Yeah... Thank you.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Black, black...
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
You charge by the hour?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What?
Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'?  You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Well, what do you really think, though?
Where you staying now?
A delivery device for nicotine.
"There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it."
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
You did good, Massey!
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
After you, Doll.
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I just want to make sure that you both --
What part?
Mr. Dumbarton.
No frown lines.  New watch?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
What do you mean, was.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
So, that's good, right?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Ruth Rabino.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
It's about time.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
Did you see the tape?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
You just haven't met the right person.
He wants a reconciliation.
Marylin! Listen to me.
Howard is a beautiful person.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
She didn't love you?
Do you want to sleep on it?
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hello Marylin.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
What kind of "stuff?"
Meaning my house.
No buts. Now. Out.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Jesus.
Please!
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I wish I had your discipline.
He has a reputation for being tough.
So where are you now?
Excuse me?
When you have a moment.
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Thank you.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
I don't know. I can assume...
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Nothing.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Muriel Rumsey.
Maybe next time.
Oh, no, sir. No different than\97
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir\97she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for\97
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to\97
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day\97whether it's coming to her or not.
Why don't you put me in chains?
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
No.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to\97  \97as long as I can get her back. 
She hasn't had a thing yesterday\97or today.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads\97all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Sock her!
Yes, sir.
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
But it's King Westley on the phone.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Oh\97the papers\97
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but\97 you've been very kind. 
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
Um. You're doing all right.
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Well, you were!
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
Not as long as I'm alive.
No.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride\97
My uncle\97Mother's brother\97had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Oh, no!
Clever.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car\97and I won't use my thumb.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Me?
I love you.
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
Thank you.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
What's that?
What's 'at?
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars\97and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Said he was gonna stay a week.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
That's right.
Yeah\97wouldn't it?
What?
You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
The anonymous kind, Chief.
At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing here, boss.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
There's a word - orders.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Yeah.
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
I did.
No, I did not.
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob. The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans. Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he's somewhere in Miami.  You're on the right track.
Same one.  I didn't know no impersonator.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
What?
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
How many shots you say you heard?
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
...and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours...
I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
Huh?
I remember he had some kinda thing wrong with his left leg.  He limped. Don't get me wrong, he's not one of those, you know, limp wrists.  He's a butch John.  You'd meet him on the street, you'd never snap.  You could go fishing with him, play poker with him, you'd never snap in a million years.  So one night we were over at Ferrie's place.  Having a party. Sometime in the late summer of '63.
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
The Warren Commission call him?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Yes.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
I don't know if I should talk about this.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
She's the best damn witness we have!
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Uh huh.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Three years.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
She wants to go back to work.
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Would you mind if we looked in that bag?
I'm not saying another word.
Okay.
Can I see your I.D.?
It's kind of a sports bar
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
I didn't?
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
Surprise.
What'd ya see?
How was it?
I'm old enough to be her father.
Right around here, in the food court.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Set him up.
I hesitated taking that much.
I didn't say you did.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Thanks, but you have a good time.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Yeah?
What the fuck is that shit?
You planted that shit on me.
You two meet?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
And splittin' with her?
What did you say?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
Great...  ...Wanda!
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
Kinda.
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
Hi, Melanie.
Do you got something for me?
I was expecting you. Come in.
Sure.
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
They told me.
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
Talk to you tomorrow.
I told them.
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
I can sit through it once.
Sure.
Bank robbery.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
What's a Metrix?
No thanks.
Yeah.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Detroit.
I don't like dancing.
Yeah.
So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
You live with him.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Yeah, down the end.
This one.
What's your cost?
Then what?
I dunno.
Sure.
Yep.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
You gonna tell me who it was?
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
He's a big one. You two tight?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
Haven't a clue.
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
House.
Beaumont worked for you.
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
Git your ass in here.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Winston found you.
Uh-huh.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
That I gotta see.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where it is.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
I was gonna tell you...
Where do you want to go?
Then what are you doing here?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Just to see you. That's all.
How do you know?
Oh, terrific.
It's hard to explain.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Now what?
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Why do you say that?
How long had that been going on?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Wiggle your toes.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
What?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
But I see them.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
This is healthy? I'll probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
Where to?
What do you mean?
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
Don't ask.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
The best.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
I don't like things that make you cry.
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
They're like demons, Jez.
Where?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What kind of man are you?
I love you, Jez.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
Don't be funny.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sit down, Jake.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Shows how much you knew.
Like it was yesterday.
So why tell me now?
Just relax.
Well that's good to know.
I don't know what to say.
If you're lucky.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Help me!
Where am I?
Last night! They were as real as you are!
I need to see you, Jake.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
What's wrong?
You in trouble?
I don't know what to do.
Oh God. I know. I know.
You come home with me.
Died?
How did it happen?
You got lucky.
Speaking of which, duck!
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We're not leaving Crutch!
THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
We don't have a choice!
We made it?
Sergeant? We thought you were...
Where'd you get the gun?
What are you gonna do, tell me?
They're back here.
Let's move out!
Thorgan, suit up.
Thorgan? You coming?!
You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
I am an expert!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
My job.
You got that right.
What?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
We have to get off this ship.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
You?
Oh sure, all the time.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
Oh I like her a lot.
Again?! Jesus!
NO!
The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Kay-em 14.
You need to get laid!
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Oh shit! There he is!
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
I love you.
No! He's coming with us!
I just know.
But?!!
See you then . . . doctor.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Get him out of there!
You wanna die?
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
I know who he is...
What do you mean 'We...?'
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Tattoo. Had it taken off.
Shut up! Just pump her out!
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin.
What kind of a shark did you say it was?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
Why?
No, we just checked the beach...
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
You could say that.
What stinks so bad?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
Florida license plate.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct.  I know sharks.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
It's a whale out there.
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I didn't know her.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Is that a boat?
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
What do you see?
I think I can top that, Mister...
He's under!
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
I don't have it.
Thanks for the message.
Cool.
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Well, I do.
Were we together?
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Excuse me?
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
No, more commercial stuff.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
Consider it your musical education.
Is Vanessa here?
You're gonna like this, I promise.
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
I actually know this one.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
What are you?
No?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I went to the doctor today.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
No thank you. I'm off sex.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You're pregnant?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Tore up from the floor up?
Unfortunately, yes.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
You sound shocked or something.
Right, seriously.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
Yeah, downtown.
Carrie.
Karma.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
...Yeah, sure.
He whips you?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sure.
Took 'em all.
I heard that.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Turkey mostly.
What do you need a Bible for?
Ain't you goin' to record it?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Nah... how much money have you got?
No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
I still think we should have met them first.
Funny, very funny.
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I don't want to talk about it.
Fuck!
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
I'm finished.
What are you going to do?
...Brian hurt his foot.
Siesta.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
Who are you?
Right, I talked to you on the phone. They say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
Without his car?
Yes!
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Yeah.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
Right.
The cartoon?
Yeah.
He looks like my uncle.
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Bet.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Yeah. Do it again.
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
Tonight?
I like you too.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
No, Fidget, I...
Because, you know why. You know.
I wouldn't believe it?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
I guess so.
One.
But I only had sex with Telly.
What?
Everything is wrong.
Yeah, I guess so.
Mine?
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Have you ever swallowed it before?
Oh god. That's horrible.
But then I won't need your money.
Shh.
When are you gonna be back?
Four-thirty in the morning?
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Yep.
Yeah.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
How'd you get in here?
I was at the beach.
Sit down!
Run it down.
Local?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
It's a voice modulator.
Did anyone stand out?
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
Then call them!
I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
He was watching you.
You're losing me.
Uh huh.
He went down to the lobby for a minute. He should be right back.  Would you like come in?
Of course.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What does that mean?
Ten days ago.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
Whatever's on your mind.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
That's not fair!
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
And you?
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
Because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
It's not that easy.
Why not?
I'm sure you are.
I don't have to go through with it either.
That's worse.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
Colwyn ...
You must move away from the Center.
That way. I can feel the cold.
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
Let us wish him peace.
You have done it?
You will not, then?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I was hoping I might be your friend.
How did you know I had sons?
You will follow me.
To the place where Death lives.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
I am Quell.
I cannot go with you, my friend.
No.
I don't think it's working.
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
Hush!
The forest is not safe these days. You'd best travel with us.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
With an old voice?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
Yes, they are weakening. It takes great power to maintain the Fortress, and they have expended much.
That is true.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
We had no children.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Yes.
Of what?
You lie!
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
...What?
...Not at all.
Huh... 500 meters?
What?
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
...Later.
A little...
...Don't you like me?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? That's smart!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Huh, that's good!
Yes... Twice.
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Salute.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
No it's not.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
What?
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
That's enough.
Can it kill me?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Then why?
You like to take walks?
I've changed my mind.
Pacifica, California.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
Not our problem.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
You tell stories?
You know what... maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run.
Nine.
Making the grand total?
Mammoth.
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Pulitzer, here I come.
Tomorrow.
Walking where?
Why know?
... The Grapes of Wrath.
Someone should be with you.
Good morning.
Yes.
Evening News?
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You what?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
No, I can't have dinner with you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Yes... I'll give you that.
They wouldn't know.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
Where have you been staying?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
No.
That's right.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
I guess.
Yes.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
I'm impressed that you took the initiative to go there and get it. That's what makes a good lawyer. And on top of that, you gained the client's trust and kept it. That's what makes a great lawyer. You're smart, Elle. Smarter than most of the guys I have on my payroll.
I'm a man who knows what I want.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Just the love in my heart.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
How about --
That's terrible!
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke.
Relation?
You know her?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. I thought that was very -- classy of you.
I know. He has it sent out.
I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
Did she do that to you, too?
My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She's completely untrustworthy.
But maybe it is --
How do you figure?
Maybe not to your face...
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What?!
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
What happened?
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Your what?
No.
No, silly. I go here.
What, like it's that hard?
Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
Thank you.
I gave her my word, Warner.
How was I supposed to know what kind of shoes you had on?
Yeah, luckily.
Faith.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
And then?
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
I didn't know... I --
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
Blackheart?
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Nay.  This time we strike first!
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Can you save her?
He'll not escape me.
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
They'll do nicely.
Never.
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Be patient.
To fetch your napkin.
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
And I... love you...
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
Aye.  And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here.  I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Sorry.
No fear of that now.
And am I not fair?
We wait.
Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Up ahead!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
You've been inside?
He was there and then he wasn't!
I wanna be with you today.
Since seventh grade.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
Mom said I should.
I love red!  That's my favorite color!
No.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Monday.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
Let's shut up and not kill her.
I can use your mom's.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I don't want you to!
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
Does everything have to have a point?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Will he talk to me?
It's thirty feet.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
That's too long.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
What can I do for you, George?
I want you both to stay.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
I almost saw Catalina.
Hey...hey!
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
How do you become something you're not?
What do you know about me?
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
What's wrong with your back?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Here.
I know there's an explanation.
She needs to be alone, I think.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
Why would they tow your truck?
Where will you live?
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
What?
Sam's favorite.
Do you remember?
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
This was my very first slow dance.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I'd rather you not be here.
I can't pick you up.
I need to know.
I didn't think you'd come today.
What?
So could I.
Don't even...I'm there.
I could use the money.
I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The payoff.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go because of Sam?
You can't go with me because of Sam?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Please don't leave me.
Do you like red?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Someone stop her!
Yes, it is.
Nagger?
Is Mae Rose okay?
And the baby?
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Not for me, it ain't.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Yes, boss.
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, Claude.
He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
Sure, boss.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Claude Banks.
Good old Monroe.
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
He even got my daddy's watch.
We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
He's dead.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
Hey, Ray...
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
He must still be in there.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
Are you offering me a bribe?
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
You shouldn't have come here.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
...their damned souls will be ours.
All right. Let me out.
Don't do it!
You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Yeah, you do...
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
I know, your wickedness.
The Dark Prince is here.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
Dude. Seriously?
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
School?
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
From my dad's side of the family.
Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
I don't know.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
Up there.
Your own work?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
I'm Mary 2.
No.  Just no.
I changed my mind.
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
Of course --
You're not going, are you?
Maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
I doubt it.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
You know, Jessica.
Yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
It could be...
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Where are you going?
Hello.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
Gracious... no.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
Alive?
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Okay.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
They're comin' with us.
Sure, I'm okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
Right... This just glided along.
Yeah... Laurent.
It's me...
We should stop seeing each other.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
Okay.
Alice, I...
Alice?
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Yeah? what did they want?
The wife killer?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
No... I don't. Why?
Nothin'.
I don't know yet.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Alice who?
A videotape.
No, nothing.
I guess so.
All right.
Why would anyone do something like this?
He's got some fucked up friends.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
No thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Okay.
We just killed a couple of people...
Sure.
I don't know.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Come on... get in.
YOU'RE SORRY!!
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm a paleontologist.
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Sounds like a stall to me.
In a quandary.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Nothing. Why?
Over by that hill.
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well - I'm\97
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Who, for instance?
You have no disputes over women?
They were.
Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
The only one.
Shall we have another?
Yes, charming.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
The High Lama! Who in blazes is he?!
Oh, I'm so glad.
Now, what would you like to do?
Are you so certain you are away from it?
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Hey!
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as\97
Oh, the girl at the piano?
But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
Do you think this will come in my time?
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
I wonder.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Bump?
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
The first thing we want to do is to cable the Foreign Office. All of England is waiting to hear about my brother. There's a cruiser at Shanghai ready to take him back.
Perhaps.
All right, I'll be there.
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
I'd go with number three.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
What?  Who the hell are you?
So what's the problem?
Why?
You don't know me at all.
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
I dunno. Why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
Get back in the car!
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
Do his job.
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
There wasn't time, sport!
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
What do we do?    Lean into it.
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
They're not my pals--
This guy.  Where was he?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
They went right to the President.
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Can you see?
Is it now?
They're inside.
Can you see the balloon man?
He'll turn around.
What is it?
Anderton --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Oh, Jesus...
That's comforting.
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
Yes, sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Uh-huh...
And who the hell is that?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
You're kidding, that's today?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
I show a cop on horseback.
Georgetown.
Did he close the front door?
Did Marks close the front door?!
We're in motion on something.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Yes.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I need your help.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
So?
They don't belong to anybody.
Hold your breath, Dad...
NO!
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You say some of the children died?
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Do you?  Really?
The safest place of all.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
He's dead, Lara.
Sean --
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Tell him not now.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
He's my subordinate!
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Right here.
There's thousands of units like this one.
We can stop him.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Who?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
I forgot my glasses.
We used to, every summer.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
You mean after he lost your son.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Is it the good room?
He's okay.
He's alright.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Mommy's not home?
Yeah. Are you sure mommy's not home? It's very late.
Where were you?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
Who's watching the baby?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
What'd you say?
5-5-1.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Ruiz tied in out there?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Quick drop. In and out.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
That's it.
This one?
She was fast, huh?
I don't understand.
No.
Yeah. Sorry.
He'll work it off.
What is it?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
What drill?
Where's the drop?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Soho.
You don't know where you're going?
No. That's cool, man.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
He's not here.
Don't be shitty.
I got no idea.
I thought you hate that club.
Then why do you try to get in?
He didn't say we need guns.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Bullshit...
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I promised Chloe we'd come here.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Pretty nice.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Yeah, I guess.
I told you what they said.
They asked who it was.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
I detected no vibe other than that Ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
C'mon, man...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm your soldier.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What do you have left?
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Let's just go now and wait.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
The line's over there.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Drinks are free, right?
Where do you live?
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?'  Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
But, Max --
What?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
And where might that be?
When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you out.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Just now.
I'm working on it.
I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
Yeah.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
Elijah who?
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
If you want to tell me.
How old are you, Betty?
Just hold me.
What do you think?
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
The talk is everywhere!
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
You have to sleep for three.
Let some of us come down there.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
You've been talking about the disciples. What color were they?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Your control over your children, therefore --
How long has this been going on?
What mission?
Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Eat lead, coppers.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Might be all right.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Allah will provide.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
He's bright.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I'll call you tomorrow.
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Si.]
[No!]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Who ordered it?]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
I drink.
What do you mean, I'm here?
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
I said the plan was right here.
Yes or no?
Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
My ankle.
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Could I stop you?
Still not a question.
Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
You got that right.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
So are you.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
It's Creasy.
She understands men.
[Yes.]
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
When?
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Don't forget your towel.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
That's ridiculous.
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
And they took that away.
Which one was that?
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
We just talked.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Well, it ain't your baby.
You told me.
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Were the lights on?
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm having a very good time, too.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
Okay.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
You gotta good heart.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
You gonna die without a son.
Waddaya read there, Joe?
Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Hello, Thomas.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Sure, sure.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Waddaya talking about?!!
She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Just one for a start.
Home.
Look at that right eye.
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
I don't drink intoxicants.
Same general idea.
Duke Forrest.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
Sixteen times.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
We could steal one of the choppers.
People will talk.
We're a good team.
Don't stop now! Please...
I can't... couldn't.
Right.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
An eternal damnation.
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Hiya, Ho-Jon. You got a piece of a shell in your chest, but we'll take it out as soon as you've had more blood. Hey, Radar!
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
I don't get it.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Homosexuality.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
You can cut the bow.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
You mean who hit who?
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
I can try, sir.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
Colonel Merrill is a veteran of twenty- five years in the Regular Army, a soldier first and a doctor second. A member of several patriotic organizations, he believes it's America's God-given mission to maintain a foothold for freedom on the Asian mainland.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Are you all right?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
About me?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Look, John\97what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a\97
Thirty dollars.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
A hundred dollars!
How do you do.
No, no, no\97that's your seat.
John! I'm so glad to see you. I\97I was terribly worried.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house\97and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and\97
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Wait a minute . . .
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Oh!
In what man!
So?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room\97under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
I got it all ready. Here.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Thank you.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
I ain't seen him for a week.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Did you find her?
Go out and find her!
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
I don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after Christmas.
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
What Bert's trying to say is\97well\97we need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
Huh? Get what?
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot\97you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people\97they ought to run you out of the country\97and I hope they do it!
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Uh-huh.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Nineteen!
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
How?
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Shh!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Deal.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Is that where you're family lives?
Yep.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
It was okay.
I don't really like to drink.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
You're a compulsive gambler?
I do.
Still needs work.
Police corruption. It's everywhere.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Pull up alongside.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You worship yourself.
What do you want from me?
If you did, you never showed it.
Scottie...
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
It's all over, babe, it's all over.
Hmm?
What?
Your concern is heartwarming.
Who's running it?
I have found in life that what one wants isn't nearly as important as what one needs.
I need to take back what's mine.
-- Because there'll be no remorse. Not in my world.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
Wake up?!
In here I am.
And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
The weather.
There is no --
You've got the keys, send someone in --
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
The truth.
Where?
If she's alive, you get it back.
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
-- Katie.
Her?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
It was a test.
Yes.
I know.
Because you'll never believe me.
Resurrection.
Male.
Speed?
Wait a second...  What time is it?
Now tell me... what do you see?
... I just pray we're not too late.
TRICERATOPS!
I think so.
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
Ryan's Comet!!
LET'S FLY!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.
If we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
BULK!!
Did I say anything?
How'd you know?
Strength in numbers!!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
And a lot more. Can we talk?
Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
Tell me about it.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Whatever you say, Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Could we step outside?
Can't we get a couple whores over?
From your mouth ta God's ear.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
He was around...
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
No. I'm here with you.
I needed to see you again.
It's a mask.
London?
It always is.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
No. We ain't even...
Like a party for all our friends.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
They don't give a shit about us!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
He's trying to make it.
So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
You gotta plan these things.
An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
I got partners.
I don't fuck my partners.
You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
They do what I tell 'em.
And what do you want out of this?
If it comes to that. Yeah.
Guess I'm just lucky.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Yeah...before your time.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pi\F1ata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Tell me what?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
You're acting kind of...odd.
Got a doctor on duty.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
I don't <u>know</u>.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Uh-huh?
That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Mm hmm.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Yeah. What about the second act?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
Yeah. Funny--
My friends?
I apologize.
I'll cherish ya.
Well, let's get going.
Right now--everything I own--!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Listen--the simpleton of all time--a big-eyed patriot--knows Washington and Lincoln by heart--stood at attention in the Governor's presence-- collects stray boys and cats--
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Look! There it is!
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For one week!
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Will he *yield*?
Mr. President--
I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
We'd better see.
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
The man downstairs said number--
J-Jefferson Smith.
Did you say--bus?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
No. What had you better--?
Some committee's got it.
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
Try sitting down.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
Go right ahead.
No!
Must have been tickled pink.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Saunders--if there was *any* way--
If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
Splendid.
I'm splendid, too.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Yes, sir--
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Yes. Good morning, Saunders.  Have you--uh--any idea how this happened?
No?
He won't get started! I'll *make* public opinion out there in five hours. I've done it all my life! I'll blacken this punk until--  Joe--your job is back in the Senate-- keep those men fighting him *there*.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Some people like it.
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Uh-huh.
Yes, you own it.
Would you like to go for a walk?
No! I resigned last week!
Yes, but I\97
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What's that got to do with it?
What's that got to do with it?
Look, this is my house. I'd like to\97
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Really?
Yes.
Huh?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
He did?
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Let's just walk, okay?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
Yes, of course.
Oh, hello darling.
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Had the boys follow us.
Shhh!
Boy, was he burning.
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, sir.
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Me sir?
Perfect! Perfect!
I wanna see that guy!
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Wants to know who the heir is.
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
You can't?
All set.
Okay.
Yes.
When?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
Oh.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
We own an opera house, don't we?
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
Ja.
Well, thanks, I - uh\97  How do you do? What is your name?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Huh?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
I write poetry.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Binge?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
Looking for?
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
Why's that?
Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
I'm fine.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Are we?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Good, then go.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Go to hell.
What?!
Now we're back on track.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My pleasure.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Do you want to come in?
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Doc. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry you're frustrated.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Oh, I don't know...
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Doc.  Ainge...
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Thanks for your help, Lionel.
Sure.
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
Oh... not a real doctor.
No, I really don't.
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
Hmm.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe you'll catch it.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is she against you getting help?
Something's bothering her.
Where?
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Disgusting.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
You're not the only one...
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Weekly or monthly?
Where was this?
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
What happened today?
No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from?
Nah... scotch.
Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
Don't you like this?
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Really?
Just you.
You were messed up, man.
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
You want my advice? Far out!
Wow.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Relax, I got him.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
Even?
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
What does he want the book for?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
I would never!
I just decked your brother
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
How?
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Got what?
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
I was mistaken.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Still...
Yes,... I see.
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
And it stinks to high heaven in here.
We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
You have got to be joking?
I know you did.
Head hunting.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I'm his daughter.
Really?
Atta, boy!
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
The Inscrutable Six?
I can't.
But you're a superhero.
I thought you'd never ask.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Thanks.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
And the nuts always call themselves great.
You're a spy.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Alone tonight?
Date?
It is?
It's home.
And what if you get killed?
Monica!
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
LOOK!
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
Yeah.
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
There's a vague similarity.
But look at him... and look at us.
Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy!
Mother... it's not what you think!
Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
The who?
Whatever our name is.
With or without him, we gotta go!
May the forks be with us!
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I, personally, am convinced that he will withdraw his army from Moscow, and attempt to establish himself in Poland for the winter.  In the end, he will not allow himself to be cut off from Paris.  But I believe that if he is offered any encouragement, by Your Majesty, he will postpone this decision as long as possible. He is a gambler and he will trust to his luck.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Where are they?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
I'm not insulted.
It is on this road, sire, following me.
The Empress, your son and the whole court left two days ago for Rambouillet.  Marshals Mortier and Marmont are probably still in Paris, completing the arrangements.
That is incredible.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Come in.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
The first reports came in at about ten.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
I'll have the fire built up.
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Do you have three francs, sir?
Lisette.
You must not act impetuously.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
I will never forgive you.
Five minutes.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Certainly.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
My God, what do you think?
God help me -- yes.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
That is a matter of opinion.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Good.
Why you say that?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
I'll do it.
Not me.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
Thanks for reminding me.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
What you mean, so?
You walked?
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I don't.
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
Naw, you go first.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
I don't know.  Probably next Friday.
I don't know.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's locked.
So what?  Let's make'em wait.
Okay.
Hold on.
It's alright.
I saw it.
Ever since my momma died the bills are always late.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
Where's Craig?
This is a knock.
Bite his ear!
He's a boy, dude.
Call me.
I got fired too.
Nothing.
What urgent message?
Keep pushing.
I don't know.
I'll take you later.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
What's the matter?
Oooh, ba-by!
Okay.  Bye, Craig.
What happened here?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
What?
San Diego.
Ah.
No.
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
You wouldn't...
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
The gun...
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Tell me why he's dead.
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I want'to talk to her.
Don't you threaten me.
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
I think you're right.
No way.
Right.
I promise.
Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there.
Oh, man...
That's right.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Don't think I won't.
Thank you.
I don't think so.
I think this is worth a dollar.
Why?
Help me get her off the rug.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Young love.
Do it!
He took the secret with him when I dropped him.
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll the skiff be ready?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
They hid in a broom closet!
IN THE RIIV-ER!
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
A man of the Cloth?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Come on!
Tricked us!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
The money, Icey.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
You better not sing that song.
Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
She talks to herself.
I'll make coffee.
Is that all?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
It -- she --
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Don't you believe me?
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Naturally.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
It's not in the river, is it Harry?
Where's she at?
She took them kids with her?
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
What?
Thank God.
Get the kit!
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately.
No.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Who?
Nan, I --
Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
I won't.
I will.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Dead and gone.
So he's alive?
We should get her out of here...
You were screaming like crazy.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Jungle man fix Jane.
No more fights.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
You should be more careful, Anna.
About what?
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Positively not!
Or it might be the firing squad!
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Right now it's on the balcony.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
What is it?
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
How many families live here with you?
No, that's bad management.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
You didn't get legal advice?
That's right.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Go to bed.
No, sir.
Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Thank you, Louis.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
Comrade.
A day.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Au revoir.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
You're going to force us... huh?
You're welcome.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
Go ahead.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Thank you.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
You know I want to...
Then how did you get here?
What are you after?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
No.
Yes.
Yes.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
My darling.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
A funny story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Yes... a little white house.
No, no music.
They belong to the people.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Good morning, Swana.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Huh?
No.
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
No... please...
No thanks, Swana.
Yes.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
Has done what?
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
In that case I can only say good-by.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
What do you want?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
I don't understand.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
Where do you eat?
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
What?
I like that.  That's a solution.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
Yes ... I got the money.
Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
I figured that out.
Yeah?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Mitchell?
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
I thought the gloves were off.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
That's what they're doing.
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
Can we get around this, Al?
How do you see this?
Sir?
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
Silence!
"Security" is not strong enough.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
Money.  Follow the money.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
Yeah, we've got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit.  That's top priority.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Sir ... six bodies.
Why me?
Yes, Mother ...
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
What ... ?
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
I know ...
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Anything goes wrong, head for your homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear from me or Howard.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Agreed.
The American people put me where I am.
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
He was, he was.  We taught a class together at Harvard.  But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
... and what do we get for it?  Gobs and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing! Someone is leaking. We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can go for the big play -- China, Russia.
There's no other choice.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
We have to entertain the possibility ...
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Yes, Mr. President.
Did you cry when he died?
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
Free, if you're the president.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
The hell with 'em.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Yes, yes.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I want a divorce.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Buddy, look at me ... just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
No, you're not.  So stop comparing yourself to him.  You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it.  Why can't you just enjoy it?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
You.  What' you're doing --
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
'Predate it.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Most don't.
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Try "old" on for size.
No.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Llewelyn Moss?
That's possible.
I'm hidin' behind you.
Believe you're right.
I'm ahead of you there.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
That's very nice.
Well. If you say so.
I don't know. Had dreams.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No. But I gave my word.
It's full a money.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
Well -- how come?
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I know where it's going to be.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Is Llewelyn there?
Step out of the car please, sir.
Yeah? Where am I?
So what're you goin' up there for.
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
With what?
See about closing.
You live in that house behind the store?
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
For what?
The kind with the most poles.
What room?
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
That's not an answer.
I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Not any way.
I didn't say braze.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
What product.
No I don't have it.
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
I don't know. American citizens.
You do, I reckon.
No sir.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
We think we know where Betty is.
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
I know plenty.
"Banners?"
...I... I know what you are.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
...to see you.
Umm, I don't think that...
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I better go check on them.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
I don't think I am.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
You knew Del?!
You're late, Eric.
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
What?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
I came for love...
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
What's his real name?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
He is real.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
No, that should be more than --
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
...that's a good motto.
...among others.
Half.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
What?
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
No! Let me try this!
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Names, a phone number, something...  Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Yeah. Why, you know him?
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
She's a lesbian.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Mr. Campbell?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
- and share one of your graves.
The law. Well the law is a human institution.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Four hundred, Delmar.
What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
Okay, Everett.
Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Problem a p'seption.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
In any state.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You said -
Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
Pete, don't be ignorant-
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Million point two.
Isn't it, uh...
Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle.
Aw, that's all right.
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
Blooey!
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
Yes, sir!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
Be a friend. Leave.
What's stopping you?
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
That's brilliant.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Shhhh...
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
But it can't wait.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
It's mine.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
She didn't.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You finish.  Then we finish.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
I did.
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Huh?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. Your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  And a bank of video monitors --
A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A castle keep, in medieval times.
It's okay, Raoul.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
0150.
People.  In the house.
What do they want?
I'm here.  I'm here.
Shhh...
No.
I was trying not to tell you...
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
I got you.
Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
You know that's bullshit.
You know it. Stay Black...
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
Look this is bull...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
No man. PE -- "political education."
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
You mean...
We're like policing the police.
Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
So talk...
Wait a second there brother...
I don't know.
Yeah... let me think about it.
What, I don't know how you mean?
Brimmer.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know. I really don't.
No.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
Pride will do.
Lovely.
Yes, sir.
Very well, proceed, sir.
I will do so as soon as possible.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Sir.
Difficult, sir.  This is, as you pointed out, a civil war.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Yes.
You're in no condition to ride.
It's already over.
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
Name five hundred.
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
Thank you.
When?
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
How many men have we seen die?
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Thank you.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
When?
But father, they might come this way.
Well...I guess not.
Am I really gonna have my own room?
I will. Come and kiss me.
Yaay!
Yayyy!
Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey...
I hate that smell.
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
I'm sure you're not.
Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Then come on.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Is there quicksand?
You're telling me.
Whose burying ground?
Why? For God's sake, why?
Your cairn.
Don't worry about that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
I guess it wouldn't hurt.
What?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Remember.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Did you see his shirt?
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
Elizabeth goes free!
Wait as long as you like.
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Men!  Are you up for it?
Or you could surrender.
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
What?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
That he is.
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
I know.  That was for the smell.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Indeed.
No.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
How?  The key's run off.
Agreed!
'Bootstrap?'
Depends.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
No.  She hasn't.
Speak.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Ain't it.
You're not rotting meat.
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
It's ready now, I know it is.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
That remains to be seen.
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
Thank you, sir.
You don't want this.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
The replicators?
I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
You know, this and that.
The big house?
It already is.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Yes.
Daniel!
Got it.
The waste.
What happens?
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
Probably the caffeine.
What did you want my hair for?
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Let's go.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
The same thing I suppose.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
We were different people then.
That's right.
The question is, are you?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
I don't mind her if you don't.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Certainly. Right over there.
You may go, Smythe.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me\97
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters\97
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
I poisoned him.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Your house?
Oh, hello Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
I'll bite. What's the catch?
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
That's so.
A what?
My play.
Sure.
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Dawson, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Oh no, sir!
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
Not since you broke into society.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Yes.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Yes - and I'd love it.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Been where?
Conrad.
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Right.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Very good.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
It'll be ready in a minute.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
I have it here.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
No, sir!
No, I ... I was just ... worried about her.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
Looks just like it did.
Sure.
Thanks ... I love you.
Yeah. It does.
No I'm not.
I don't want it to go away.
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
You want to get out of here?
Why not?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
One of those ... big beds?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
No. Of course not.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Yes.
No way.
We're supposed to be in school.
To who?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
It's fine.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Oh ... Hi.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
What?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Rain.
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
Yeah ... Sort of ...
My name's David.
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
No you're not.
Why?
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
... Yeah.
Yes.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
Why?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Hi.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
What happened?
Yeah. 
Cool.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
No, no, no.
So it's ok if I bring her.
I don't know.
It's fine, but --
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
I have no idea.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I just want to know where she's staying.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
I'm just laying on my bed.
I'm in my bedroom.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
Can I ask you a question?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I have to go.
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
I don't know.
Not very well.
Thank you.
Ok.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
No. I'm the exact opposite --
It's terrible, no.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Sure.
Nothing.
Ok.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yeah...
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
What do you mean?
Lena?
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Yeah......yeah.....
This is funny.
For what?
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Ok, bye, bye.
Did you do it?
How?
Sorry.
Hello, how are you?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
What?
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
I didn't know you had a sister?
....I have seven.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Yes I'm fine.
....yes.....
You should go on a trip.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Alright, alright.
Well....what do you want, then?
You can't be late though.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
At your service, Count.
"...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
Yes, Abbe?
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
"Turn you out?"
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You among them?
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Good day, Marquis.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
I know, because I felt it myself --
Then it must've been love --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
His wife's influence.
And his writing?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
What could cause a tincture like this?
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
There's something else I want from you.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Go on, child.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
....shame on you, truly...
Very much.
Not you too
I wonder sometimes.
Houdini mice.
He needs me here.
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
I'll remember that.
Why is that, Louis?
Darling, I talked to Millicent.
She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently.
I am not that woman.
There is nothing to discuss-
I will not have this in my home.
I don't want you to--
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Can I talk to Hearst?
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
We're doing Hearst.
I expected more from you.
And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ...  great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - -
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
They don't have to.
And what does he see?
But it's not a great syllable
So they're Jews. . .
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Again
Ah, it's a grand title.
The ad..
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
It's just that my movie is so-
The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
For what?
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You want the title shot?
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Yeah, I know.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Does that mean...
You sound bitter.
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
It's OK.
Now take your panties off.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
Yeah, what?
What did I do?
All I did...
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I went to the movies.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Don't make no difference no more.
He should.
I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
But his leg!
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Well, officer -- do your duty.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Thanks.
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Your logic is backward.
That depends on who "they" were.
A possibility.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Congratulations, Jeff.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Who are you?
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
And some man will lose his.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
Police?
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Got a shovel?
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Tired?
I wish there was one I wanted.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
I think it's enchanting.
Of course not.
Without any future?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Nothing, thank heaven.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
I don't know.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Is he cleaning house?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
I'm glad they let you out.
What?
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Down in back.
I think I should go home.
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
I was in it.
Have some cigars.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I'll wait for him.
Hi there.
I don't want to make friends.
I know.  That's why I came back.
No.  In the morning.
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
We know.
There's only one key.
Hey!  How 'bout that!
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
No.  At dawn.
My gun?
Just a guard.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
Good Lord!
Just tell a little white lie?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Grandma?
No.
Leave me alone.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
"Life is crushing in on me."
You were looking for me, weren't you?
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
No.
What?
I didn't want to stop.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
Gabriel -- !
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
We're talking, aren't we?
No, baby. He wants me.
...whoever she is.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
No, no --
Then he shoulda signed his name.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could live it up and --
NICK!
Nick...
What the fuck is going on.
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Nick...
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
They all are. Football's on.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I'm glad it was me.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
Hey.
I don't know.
And I worked there. For a year.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
More than you know.
Put it on.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Six men means six guns.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
And where they hide the real money.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
I don't steal any --
Where is he?! Where is he?!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Not with you.
Not yet.
I'm just saying.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
And you set me up.
I... sorry, Mister...
There is no other table --
I'M NOT NICK!
Who the hell made this map.
Since when? What the hell is this room?
Yes.
Fine, now.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
You ain't dying, he is.
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
This isn't all that bad. We can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put you on the rotation at Long Beach as a dock worker.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on this. I've seen it happen.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
You can do some crazy things with it.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What the hell did you expect me to do? Just forget about you?
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
Dead as Dillinger.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
Sorry, it's my book now.
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
It's a surprise.
Nice Guy Eddie.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Lie back down, and try to -
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
Shot my way out. Everybody was shooting, so I just blasted my way outta there.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Well, he knows a little about me.
I told him my first name, and where I'm from.
He asked.
Fuck you, White! I didn't create this situation, I'm just dealin' with it. You're acting like a first- year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a professional. They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created. So if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
What are you gonna do about him?
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Nobody. The light was bad.
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Yeah.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
What?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
All right -- it's said!
I suppose that's my fault.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
A man I used to know.
And meet him there.
I won't again.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
I don't care what she asked you.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
Nobody asked you to.
What's there to be fair about?
What's there to be fair about?
I said I didn't care.
Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
Yeah.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
And we're running out of that.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
Will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
I sure would.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Good night, Steve.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Would they be good to eat?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Oh, sure.
Steve --
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Okay... maybe that would be best.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
It looks like the furnace.
Huh?
No. Keep rubbing.
Listen to me I --
Then what are we going to do?
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
It's the sequel.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Not in a thousand years.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
I don't need your help.
Just wait, you'll see.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Gear. You know, clothing.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
What are you getting at, Professor?
There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
Saw who?!
Are these all the subjects?
Any of them hot?
They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
How are we going to get them all up there?
In about fifteen minutes.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
Hi.
And sexy.
Yours, or the turkeys?
My help?
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
Father, come in, please.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
How is she?
What?
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Mother? 
No more violence... No more violence...
I certainly did not.
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Why?
I'm so happy I could shit.
You scared me.
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
That's nice.
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Oohhhh, Eugene!
Oooohhhh.
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
I beg your pardon?
I didn't do it!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I certainly was not!
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
It's sugarless.
We all have bad nights. 
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Yes, but I lent it...
Now, here's a babe!
Sure I do.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Which room is it?
Yes, I understand.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
As a man, you distrust me \97- perhaps you believe me as a physician.
I can't understand it at all.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
Thank you.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
But you do believe me?
I saw him on the floor. He was cut -\97  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him \97\97 white \97\97 and the men holding him up between them.
Yes.
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
We've tried so long to find her.
Good night.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
That you love Mary.
I'm afraid.
I won't get lonely.
Yes.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
Yes.
I don't know.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I understand.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
My dear fellow, it's neither your business to ask, nor mine to tell.
But why come to me?
I've lost my knack.
I'd forgotten.
I think it's time.
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
A gay lot -\97 Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
We haven't even begun tea yet.
False alarm.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh, lots of reasons, most of them boring. But, up until I dropped out, John and I were... very much alike.
Who's Elizabeth?
No.
How do you mean?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
Maybe you want to go.
I know.
Yes.
Why not?
Then do it.
Sometimes. Afterward.
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Absolutely not.
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Do you want me to stop?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
Yes.
No.
And now you can?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I'm not planning on it.
I'm not in love with you.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
Yes.
I don't care.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
Well, are you?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
Not very often.
What do you mean?
Yeah, so?
Radon leakage?
Is he still at your house?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Yes.
Why?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, I wonder why.
And... do whatever it is you do.
Will you stop? Jesus.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You don't know that for sure.
Did he touch you?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
What is it?
There's a phone here.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She still is.
Nope.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
What do you get?
Talking.
Nothing.
Absolutely not. They are for my private use only.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Very much live.
So make an exception.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Cynthia. John.
You told Ann about this?
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Graham.
No.  You said three-fifty?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
You were prying before?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
So is my wife, asshole!!
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yeah.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Yes.
No, nothing.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
No. I don't think so.
Down to the incinerator.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Nick, you're so strange...
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Gonna cut me open?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
Did I say anything?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
Who was she?
OK. I'll think about it.
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Lemme clarify for you.
I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
A wreck.
Fools!
Time to check with Flavors.
What's cookin', Bert?
What?
I've caught it once or twice.
After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
LITTLE BLACK DRESS
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Everything's free there.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
...closed?
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
Absolutely correct.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
Of course.
You're practically naked!
I'm sorry, Officer.
OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
No...couldn't I do this later?
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Foods!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
I don't think he intends to go that far.
WHAT A JOKE...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
You guys having fun?
Good. That's good.
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I love you.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
Gary.
Say, is Maya working?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
You should get back together with Victoria. She was good for you.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Not so bad yourself.
No, I'm an actor.
Maybe. Recognize this?
No, we're paying for the wine.
Well, in that case...
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
I owe her a call anyway.
Want some?
So you're going to stop acting?
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
And she likes Pinot.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
So what's the plan today?
Beautiful.
Miles.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
You have the keys.
With Maya?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
We were supposed to play golf.
She's been leaving messages here too.
I will.  See ya!
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Can you give me some room here?
Could be anything.
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
You have to tell me --
No.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Thanks.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
The plan is... you go.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Hold on.
You need a new car anyway.
Whatever. Sorry.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Sure.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
I know. I love that.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What about me?
Like what a fraud he was.
Got it.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me.  And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Victoria.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
See you over there, Miles.
Both.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
You fucking bastard! Lying piece of shit! You're getting married on Saturday? What was all that shit you said to me?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Only for pee or poop.
This one?
No dad!
It tastes funny.
My ballet recital.
Who said I was going to die?
...I will.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
Just make noises then.
Yes it was.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
I got him.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What time is it?
Ray Reddy's house.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
That means they're unemployed.
Bimboo?
I just asked his name.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
What did you say?
You'll lose the signal!
It's like War of the Worlds.
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
McKendrick.
Sounds good.
Yeah... maybe. So long.
I'm sorry.
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
They've been kind to me.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
This is a brutal land.
I already did that.
This is where Baxter and Hawley brung us.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
I haven't done anything.
I had to get up anyway.
Going to Turley, was it?
I understand.
Anybody got any ideas?
I'll be around.
I'm going to California with my brother.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
Last one to the Midnight Star buys.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
He'll be here.
I'm done talking. Get out.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
You're kidding.
I was afraid of that.
Who did it?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
Rae, I need help.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Good luck, Mal.
I just got to town.
Luck, I guess.
This is a lot of money.
So we understand each other?
He left me.
Who?
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Okay -- for you.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
Spare me.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
"Forever".
She'll drive herself.
What about it?
Better late than never.
You really think so?
Viktor, you should have said something.
Excuse me?  Start?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
Impossible.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
Hello, is this Elaine?
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
It was a great show, Dad...
So you did meet her?
Well, I --
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
Is that a problem?
Please put your clothes on
You don't secretly want the attention?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
And what may I ask brought this on?
Clyde.
It was more in passing.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
I know what you mean.
Simone!
Good for you, Hank.
I've seen them all before.
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
I love you too, daddy.
Lainey...
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
Er,... good.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Long live the First Amendment.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Yes, I'd like that.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
No, just one.
Dr. Crowe.
I guess they don't.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
He your best buddy?
What about Mrs. Marschal?
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
Your eyes told me.
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
What?
Never mind.
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
No.
I guess she did.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Oh my God.
...I don't know.
Chuck E. who?
How'd he know I'd come?
Meaning?
What are you talking about?
Nope.
Tramp.
Not according to these.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Manure... is life.
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
What's wrong?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Who? Us?!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
Yeah?
Nah. Just you.
Look. You want to talk about this?
You never had trouble communicating before.
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
Don't look.
Spider.
Like what?
Jeez, what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Why bother?
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Hey, Grant.
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
I'm sorry.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Aspirin.
Shelby!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
All the rib eyes?
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
That's disrespectful.
My present?
Grant, no!
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
Margaret.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
You paying for the gas?
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Having fun.
They're both a challenge.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
Bandit II?
Yes.
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
That's me.
Another time.
How'd you know?
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
But I still don't think...
Go.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Can a pig whistle?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Yeah, guy?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Then don't.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm cucumber cool.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
That's the point, Dickey.
Chickenshit money.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
Damn... alright then.
Yeah, why.
...About what?
I'm not doing cocaine.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
Then what --
Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
...See, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
...So you made another deal?
No... We're trying to save Heller.
I don't see it like that at all.
I'm here.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
Yeah, I can front this.
None whatsoever.
Yeah... Sid?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
Like a mafucka.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
What!?
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
All right.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
What?
Where's Sartorius?
Shut up.
To who?
I don't know.
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
No.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
To calm your anxiety.
I want you inside me right now.
You didn't look very happy.
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
You don't love me.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
Not this time.
It's all right.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
Who are you, then?
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
There's a phone in the car.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Beg pardon?
Not too sure about that.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I came on at 8:00.
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
And "is"...?
I don't know.
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
Oh that thing in Queens.
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Do you dance?
You take care.
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Your what...?
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Not great.  I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
You don't want to hear about it.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
It's not your taste.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
I'll be right up.
You talked to his wife?
What's the difference?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
No.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Right behind you, T.J.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Ever shot anyone?
Is she injured?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
What the fuck you doin'?!
I know where everything is.
She's taking singing lessons.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Harry\85
Don't be pitiful.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
Frmpph-yrr.
Hmf-hrr?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Just call me Spidey.
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
How very dull, Peter Parker.
Huh?
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
This from a girl who still plays with dolls.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It'll shut itself off.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
See?  You big dullard.
Aunt May, what happened?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
I will finish what I've begun\85
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Actually, I got this spider bite\85
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
I'll try. Thanks.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
What?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Plenty.
Static!
Roger.
Coming up.
That'll do.
I don't know anymore.
Who is it?
Yeah. Security.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
Look, this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove. So will you let me eat it in peace?
You stink, Sefton!
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
I'll call the whole pot.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Yeah.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
What exactly is he charged with?
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
Animal! Animal! Aren't you ashamed of yourself? A couple of guys are trying to escape and you're thinking of broads. Broads?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
What's the award?
It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
She'll never forgive me!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Why, sure!
Anything else?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Are we boring you?
It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
You did!
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Shoot!
Just what makes you so popular?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Thirty-fifth.
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
Tell you what to do. First, get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the Kraut guards. Then get yourself another face.
He is.
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
I have to find a way to get to Soran.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
One minute to warp core breach.
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
You're in the Nexus.
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
It's our pleasure.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
You could say that.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
I thought you might.
A photon torpedo?
What do you want?
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Understood. That will be all.
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
What is it?
I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it --
... Fascinating.
David --
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
Grissom, your message acknowledged. Will advise... Out.
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Aye, sir!
Only one thing, Sir... Get him off this planet... His aging is part of what's going on around us...
What? What are you saying?
Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Come on!
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Welcome home, Jim.
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Admiral, your young friend is mistaken. I meant what I said. And now, to show my intentions are sincere... I am going to kill one of the prisoners.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
How is that...?
All true.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Carol!
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe...
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
I don't understand. Who's responsible for all this? Who is Khan?
But we can't just sit here -- !
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Let them eat static.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
KHAN!
Chekov, who is this man?
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
Give the word, Admiral.
Aye, sir.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Yes, SIR.
The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Best we could do in two hours.
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Or the one.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Erased...
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
All stop, sir.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Engage warp engines --
Trying, sir!
I'll try, Captain.
Aft thrusters, sir.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
Where must you go?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Gillian --
A moment alone, please.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
Mr. Sulu... Take us home...
Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
Cramps.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I liked him better before he died.
Your perception is correct, Doctor... In order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd Century, I have used our journey back through time as a referent, calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve.
... Best shot...?
It is.
We're just -- observing.
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Like what?
All right. Let's take it from the top.
I'm wery sorry, but --
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
I was not.
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
I buy that. What about him?
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
What do you mean now?
What's what?
Who do you think I am?
Noon tomorrow...?!
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Yes.
Yes?
I see.
Thank you, Spock.
Right.  Will you help us?
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Yes, sir.
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
Uhura!... Where!
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Mr. Scott -- how soon?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
But not you.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
What's the rush?
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I aspire to be more than I am.
Sometimes I do.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
No.
And our people?
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Is it safe to move her?
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
Another time.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
Scan for lifesigns.
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
We'd have to tag every one of them... that would take time... and we don't have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the Federation...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
You got me, Commander.
On screen.
How long 'til they reach us?
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Aye, sir.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Ask them.
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sir?
Beam him out!
I'm not letting go of him.
Transferring controls to manual.
No, sir. It is a gorch.
Say the greeting again...
Good question.
Was I doing something to your neck?
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
Augh?
Absolutely.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
At least four hours.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Bag him.
I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
No... no, please... you cannot...
I believe so.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
I told you, there's no --
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them.
Tell her to go back to Resurrection.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Ready.
Great name. French?
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
Something wrong with that?
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Yes, he is.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
You're lying.
Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
Some.
I have to...
That's impossible.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Aye, sir.
Fire!
Worf... torpedo... now!
We're still in Earth orbit.
Life signs?
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
We've lost Bridge control!
Nothing.
Do we have any idea how many Borg we're dealing with?
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
I wish I knew. Uhura?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
We've been set up all along.
Suppose HE'S holding a grudge?
That cunning little Vulcan...
She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
They'll make it look like an accident...
Very much.
You feign ignorance?
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
That isn't true...!
Those words WERE spoken by me.
I am.
I know what you mean...
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
Who else?
Shields up. Battle stations.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
There's a reward for your death.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Candidate for what?
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
They're dying.
I am uncertain.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
What peace conference?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
I'm going aboard. Spock, you have the conn.
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Not as yet, sir.
I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
We've been ordered to -
You having hearing problems, mister?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
I've already addressed that question, Mr. Scott. We'll e able to follow the Captain's movements.
Nevertheless.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
I know precisely where he'll be.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Yes, sir.
No.
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
For how long?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Is he very much like you were?
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
To happy endings.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Good work. The download?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
Emergency force fields are holding.
Thank you.
Do you have a moment, sir?
This isn't real.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
Theories?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
I'll take care of it, sir.
Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-seven photon torpedo bays, primary and secondary phased shields.
On screen.
Aye, sir
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Thank you, sir...
Counselor?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Yes. The eyes have it.
I know.
You're not Reman.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
You know that's not possible.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
He is what his life has made him!
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Should I raise shields?
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
She is here.
They're holding position.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Silence, Romulan!
I don't want to scare them away.
No, we can handle this.
We should have. Let me see.
No.
Thank you.
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Oh shit!!!
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
No, we don't.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
Marc Shermin.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Don't... don't do this... please...
What.
Eh... police.
Money.
Minneapolis.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Space?
Candy.
A drink.
It was yellow.
I do not understand.
Three nights... two days.
I need you.
No.
When we get here.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Yes.
Go?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
I understand.
Why?
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
That was beautiful.
On the radio they say it's good.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Come on.
I feel better if I move.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
No.
But...
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I will say that we can be friends.
I must go.
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Doesn't make sense.
Bullshit!
Wait'll you see it.
I don't understand.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
You saw that?
I wouldn't think so.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
What's all this squid shit?
No problem.
Leave him alone, Tran.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Watch and see.
Forget it's there.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Damn right.
Tell me.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Thanks, Max.
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
He records himself raping and killing her--
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
W'sup, Max?
Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in on Tran last night.  Another slick Lenny move.
You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
Where's Faith?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Naawww.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Skip the art criticism, Tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Sleaze to peddle.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Yeah, but that was for love.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
That's where it gets a little strange.
Now you're really getting paranoid.
This tie doesn't go with blue!
No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Uh unh.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
This seems a little sophisticated for them.  These are not subtle guys.
You really want that on your head?
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild, or, lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler, Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent, Koessler administrative, I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
That's right, Jan.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
What?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
You must get lonely. You ever think about, you know... 
Not bad, huh?
What's wrong with me?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Another what?
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Go ahead.
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I don't believe this.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
Huh?
No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
I know.
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
How are we going to find him?
I'm going to Amarillo.
Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy, figure it out.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
He's moved on to TV.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
It's over for you.
I don't know about that.
What kind of car do you drive?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
What's that like?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Tell me about it...
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
What else is going on?
My pleasure.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm a "Dorothy".
Did you get it?
...And she's with someone else.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Listen. I had a great time.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
I thought you met someone else.
...the Michelin commercial...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
You don't call.
Right.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Kinda.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. It's kinda cool. It's like you're in on some kind of secret. You tell a chick you've been some place, it's like bragging that you know how to find it. The only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. You have to have someone come before. There is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's kinda like Judaism...
Ah, there's the rub...
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
I'll be your winger.
I didn't make it...
Sure.
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
Make someone bleed.
He's trying to be an actor.
You asshole.
...People get carjacked...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
What Vegas?
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Whu?
That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Yea, how much?
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's go.
What an asshole.
Did she, or did she not smile.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Hold on.
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She thought you were money.
Michelle went for you, right.
How?
This version doesn't have fighting?
It's on.
What?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
No, baby!
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
...How novel.
Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
What was cold about it?
You think?
...and teeth... And she's like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
...you're money...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
...it's on.
I'll come to you when I need you.
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
Barzini.
Yeah.
What percentages for my family?
He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
You understand him better than anyone.
And with prison record.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
How do you know I come from America?
You look good, too.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Mike!
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
We're all tired...
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
Mama, no.
Michael, I love you.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
Please say it.
OK. 
Can I go to the hospital with you?
Don't you want dinner first?
Let HER ask.
You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
What?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
I do renounce them.
I do wish to be baptized.
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
He talked to you?
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Sure. Any time.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
What?
I love jazz.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
No!
Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
What club?
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
That's good.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
So tell me.
Marge and I are getting married.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Aye, aye.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas?
Have you done something to your hair?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
I hope she never knows.
What's going on?
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I'm fine.
Sure.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Hello Marge!
And you, sir? Any better?
What?
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
I hope so.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
Where have you been since then?
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
I can't later.
Ten thirty?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
I give up.
What do you want to change about this moment?
All kinds of things. Making plans.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Was who Meredith?
I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Yes?
Postmortem?
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
Huh?
Huh?
Nah. I ain't interested.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Oh. Who was that again?
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
I mean porno movies.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
You forgot "sexy".
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
Awh, come off it, Pal.
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
One-Ball McCall?
Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
Easy.
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
That's not hard to do.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Yes I am.
I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
No Sir.
Military record?
You moonlightin?
Why?
What kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
Funny, you don't look hip. 
O.K., cowboy.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah?
Things got ya down?
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You want to talk about it?
You know how I feel about what you do.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
I'm a field agent.
You suppose?
It's all I could think of.
Wrong.
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
I wish you were coming with me.
Okay.  What's the second thing?
You look... different.
Why me?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Yes.  Hic!
Oh...
Oh.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Yes.
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Start with what you knew then.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
I... I need a drink of water.
Well, son, you're home!
By all means.
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
When did I leave?
Ah.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Anybody take it?
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Then I'll call you a cab.
Pete...
Wish I could say the same thing.
Aren't you coming?
I... I don't believe this.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
And I won't be a communist anymore.
No thanks.
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
I taught you that.
What?
No.
Yeah... me too.
Oh.
Oh.
I thought you...
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
No.  Absolutely not.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
It's a lovely garden.
Yes.
Thank you.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
All right. 
I despise it.
How'd you happen to come here?
A trifle.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Look.
Cathy!
Take them.
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't know yet.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
Is she all right?
The little Brenner girl.
Morning.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Okay.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
No. Here's fine. 
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I know, Mother.
I don't know.
That's a chance we have to take.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Yes.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
And if you don't?
Would you like me to go for her?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
That's all right.
Monday?
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Yes?
How do you know Annie?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
Famished.
He was watching a ball game on television.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Yes, but...
I told you what happened in Rome!
What do you do?
Like what?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
What?
Are you staying?
It's an uprising.
Certainly, of birds.
Mmm?
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
At Annie's house. She's all right.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
I have no idea.
What were the crows after at the school?
To...  To kill them.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
No one called it a war!
With smoke.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
Excuse me.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
Well? And are you not a good student?
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Pulse?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
It was a woman when we put her in.
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I wanted to see the white horse --
They're uncommon bold, the grave robbers -- and the daft doctors who drive them on.
A doctor?
I am the best man for the job.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
I've ordered nothing from you.
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Burke them?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
Three years.
Aye --
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
You can get out.
I'll get him.
He must leave me alone.
I'm looking for my friends.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Keep that thing away from me.
I don't know you, man.
A job. Construction. Twelve an hour.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
He didn't kill her.
Yes I do, I really do.
I know the guy leaves a sign.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Honey. I just can't.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Watch out!
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
That was my first question.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
That's what I came to see you about.
I leave that in your hands.
That can easily be arranged.
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
Sit down, Mr. Harley.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I can judge only by what I see.
You ready?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I feel different right now.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Jittery is the word.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
May I see you for a minute?
Yes--?
What time is it?
It won't work.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Where is the meeting going to be?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
That's right.
They would have killed this man?
You better get some fresh air.
Time to activate Plan B.
Zero.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Maximum body-count.
Why?  They're only noodles.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Sam, don't --
It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
This is Michael.
No, Laddie.  It was a <u>memory</u>.
Oh, no, you won't.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
Do I look that needy?
I hear this is the decade for cute.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
I hope so.
It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
No... no, everything's different now...
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
So do I!
That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
I'm so excited I just can't hide it.  I'm about to lode control and I think I like it.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
What would that make Mom?
Don't turn on the light.
Nanook...
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know.
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Finish what?
Watch Clark.
Ain't it there?
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Now who'd go and do...
Now hold on, you dumb...
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
If it did get to him.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
The dogs?
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
All in Norwegian.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
How far's that?
Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
Don't let up, Childs!
Little over two hours.
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
We going to make it?
Can you think of any other tests?
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Just keep looking.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
MacReady, that you?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
And everyone looks like us?
I'm so sorry, Kalen.
But there's nothing here.
Morlocks --
Yes.
Oh, shut up.
This is the way in?
What do you mean?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I don't understand.
Created?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Because...
I just love mechanical things.
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
What's happening to the moon?!
Sorry... I was distracted.
I need to... um... talk to you.
You know I can't.
Holding you... again.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma, I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing, it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
I've seen it.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
How romantic...
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
Oh?
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Hiding?
I would.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
Thank you...
Every night.
Yes.
I can see Kalen's point.
Orion's belt...
You know this?
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
Mara --
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
We don't know.
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
They've gone to a better place.
We choose to believe it.
Then it's time to change that --
Dean Fulton...
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Depends on what you're seeing.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
That's too bad.
You sure you know where to find one?
And what does that mean?
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No, we were patients.
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
I never touched your father! I swear!
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
They should just be looking harder.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
Sure.
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
Yes.
I know.
I don't know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
There're no cars on this street.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Why?
Maybe.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
You still don't believe me, do you?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Sure.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
I'm not sure.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Thanks.
You remember it?
I'm sorry.
No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause if he is, then he and I got somethin' in common.
What's wrong?
What for?
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Hi.  I'm okay.  How are you?  Long time no see.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Fishing.  Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me.  This is serious.  I'm in trouble and I need you to help me.  Can you do that?
Not yet.
Call me back.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
You wanna let me see your license, please?
Am I in trouble?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
How come he let you go?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Yeah!
Get the car.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
Give me the keys.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
You're right.
You mean now or before?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Well, you got it now.
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
I believe you.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
Yeah, you want it?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
It's grand!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
The thing's kind of heavy.
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Yeah, but he was successful.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Yeah, right.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Well... at least now you know.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Thanks.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
No thanks.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Some buildings I'm working on.
That sounds like fun.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
Warren!
Who the hell's Woogie?
You don't buy what?
Huh?
Three different guys?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Good good.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Do what?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Your turn?
Same here.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Kim and I are close friends!
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
And you met Mary how?
How'd you manage that one?
Nice.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
What's that supposed to mean?
All right for awhile? The guy's good- looking, rich, witty. He was a god.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Why?
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Just a minute.
You betcha!
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
You got what stuck?
What?! No please, sir --
No, that's really unneces --
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Bye, Ted.
What --
We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
You mean there's something more important than votes? Didn't think I'd live to see the day, Ken.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Still heading for Cuba.
Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
He was.
Dean Rusk!
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny?
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it.
You're my hero, Carl.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
What journey?
Seven.
You crashed my file?
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
Yes.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
No way, Cooch.
Let the press through.
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
-- Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed Leo's spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four days mold.  Electromagnetic printing.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
What are you talking about?
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What do you mean?
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
What?
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
I read, Cooch.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Leavenworth a tough joint?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I'm with someone.
I saw one.
You know. The finger.
You let me make a fool of myself.
And far too aggressive.
Apology acknowledged.
Too aggressive?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
The what?
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
I'm starting to sense that now.
You're an animal.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
And now?
You always get what you want?
I'm still second best.
Where'd you get it.
What?
Not to me.
What do you want?
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
How does it go?
Who's gonna win?
Yes sir!
Remember one thing.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
NO. NO GOOD.
Not anymore.
BREAKING LEFT!
Roger, I've got it.
Yawing right.
You go. I'm staying with it.
Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
So's my Johnson.
So I heard. Steers it pretty close. Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was a good man.
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
They should have warned you about that one.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
I didn't ruin her.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
No. You can be mine!
I think I can work it out on my own.
Just below ten thousand.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
The wings..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
No bother.
You think I should quit?!
I know.
It's not true.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
And you get a kickback.
Take me to the hotel.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Thank you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Yes, sir.
Don't be an idiot.
What is it?
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
Nice to meet you.
Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
Eight years.
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
At Rekall.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Watch your mouth, Captain.
Arrest that woman!
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
Harry!
You went to Rekall, remember?
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
How did I get in this taxi?!
Mmmm.....
Nobody.
You know I do.
Yeah, sweetheart?
You went to those brain butchers?!
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
I love you.
There's something I have to tell you...
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
The one in the mine!
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Ready as we'll ever be.
That's four.  Let us know if it starts moving, Burt.
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I think I scared it!
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
Do not talk to the driver.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Adios, bridge!
If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Yeah.  Where's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Me, too.
I'm gonna help you.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
God, what a stink!
Could be.
Okay, ten dollars.
Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
You okay?
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
An hour after you picked it up!
I'm dead. We're both dead.
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
Correct.
Absolutely.
No it is not, Mr. Dowd.
-- With objection!
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
Chinatown street gang.
-- The Nazi he knifed?
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
Eddie... I don't know about this...
What, the lunatic who --
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
I feel much better now.
1530 Rivington Street.
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I'm not that desperate.
Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
...For ten years, now.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Exactly what happened then?
"Painted"?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
See-cil.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
Y-yes, sir.
No, s-sir.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Calls for speculation.
No? Then what did he say?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
A woman.
Blonde.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
What was?
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Thank you, Carl.
More popular than Uncle's Day at a whorehouse.  GOD DAMN, THAT MORNING SUN IS BRIGHT! BLUE BRIGHT.
Did she have someone with her?
Was there an argument?
Not a lot around here, no. Got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
That's alright. I was having a bad dream. I was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
What?
I'm up to speed, Stanley.
Where's Hap?
She only worked here a month. Nice girl. Never seemed to get here on time though. Ask me she had a little problem with --
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
That's good.
Cole said she was 17.
I think that's a good idea.
I'll get my kit.
She's wearing a ring.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Well, why not?
Donna, are you my best friend?
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
No, you should forget about last night.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Brother, I hear you talkin'.
But Bob isn't real.
What does Bob say?
No... No...
Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob.  Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
I'm not.
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
You know it and I know it.
What?
See what?
Trees?
Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
I understand.
What?
Mom... what are you wearing?
Good night, sweetheart.
Fine.
Dad...
We're late to get to your mother.
Guy just pulls up out of the blue... I mean... what is this world coming to?
Yes.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
Who am I?
That's right.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
There's no one here.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
How did you settle on the amount?
And no one will know the truth.
Mickey told me to come back to work.
I wouldn't do it.
'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
You've just said you signed it.
That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion.
Just as you are, Sir...
No.
Objection.
Frank Galvin. We've met before.
Nothing further, your Honor.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Yes.
She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
Hold on a second.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
No, you did fine.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
Yes... I... yes.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
Why?
Mrs...
Yes.
Yes...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
Yes.
Thank you for seeing me.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Mr. Concannon...?
Overruled...
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
I... do you want me to leave?
I...
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
Stop pressuring me...
No... no...
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I didn't do it, Mister.
It's locked.
...I know. I went...
...fifty thousand dollars?
...I understand...
...I understand...
Yeah.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I think we tried that. The case is over.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
Should I?
Me, too.
Let's go.
All right - I've seen enough!
Then our first target will be the initial landing place outside Los Angeles.
But I think I know where she'll be....
Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
Automobile ignitions are insulated.
Would you like some coffee, General?
Can you handle one of these?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I wonder if they're going through this too...?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
It might give us something.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
He's very excited about it.
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
Yes, but...
I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
No biggie, really.
You get any sleep last night?
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
What?  What kind of episode?
No...
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
Finish, please!
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
Quake knocked you off your feet.  You got bumped pretty good, actually. 
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
They wouldn't let me...
It can be captured, sometimes.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Black's fine.
Yep.
Guilty.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
Okay.
Whatever.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
That's not why he's sending me.
It was a bad dream...
Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
We all have problems.
They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
No, I didn't.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Fine.
Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
Come on man, what'd they look like?
How do you know?  They might.
Jesus, you never told them?
Face what?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
This is a working ship.  Promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  Had we been ready, I can assure you we would have sailed.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
Well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
Okay donut.  Whatever you say.
You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
You know what he is talking about here?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
No.  Bring him on deck with the others.
What?
About anything.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
It wasn't hard.
No.  I didn't.
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Artie? That you, Artie?
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Yessir.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
Sorry to hear it.
You an indian?
Ready for another?
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
When did you talk to Lula?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol.  Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Set one up.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
...Asshole.
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
See ya downstairs.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Didn't he say somethin'?
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
What happened to him?
Hell, peanut...
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
What kinda trash talk is that?
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You certain?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
One bad car accident...
Fan works.
Yeah?
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
Love you, too.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
That was in Vietnam.
What?
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Lead the way.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
No.
Santos... I can't...
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
I didn't see nothin'...
Thanks...
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
So I hear.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
She's a transvestite.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
Because... because...
Tripp.
Hit your brakes.
Shit.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
His parents.
Competence.
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
Don't touch it.
...we find the jacket.
That was MacCaulay.
He was never able to reproduce them.
Do you know he won't expel him?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs...  Improvise. You're good at that.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Excuse me?
It's mine.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
Her dog, yes.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
'Fraid so.
Shoot.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
It's very convincing.
Sounds like a good one.
It's colder in there.
So I'm told.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Hm.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Hm.
Glaucoma?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Because of my coat?
The hell I am.
I didn't mean it that way.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
In a minute. Get us a table.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
Oh. Well. I...
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Is the thing -- is it over?
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Oh?
I'm not sure that's possible.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Her husband.
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and --
A jockey? You mean, like --
Just kidding.
I haven't heard of half of those.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
No shit.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
K through sixth.
How old is Anna?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
You need a table.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
No thanks.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Is that right?
The mother sure has her hands full.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Do you come here often?
I'm not pretty.
Have a seat.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Woodsman?
Little Red Riding Hood.
Know what?
I could take you downtown.
It's a free country, isn't it?
Yes.
Apartment's okay.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Can I ask how old you are?
How come?
Yes?
Are you sure?
Does he?
What will happen if I do?
Your daddy will always love you.
I don't mind.
Reflect.
How's that?
I'm still thinking about it.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
I don't need someone else.
I know --
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
I don't know.
What?
Why?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I see my sister.
In my bed too.
It was a small house.
Me?
What?
I like the noise.
What?
What?
You're still here.
Maybe later.
The morning?
How young?
What?
No you don't.
You never asked them about it?
Maybe you should be.
Just think about it.
What's it look like?
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
What's your fucking problem?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
Maybe their whole technology is based on that. Controlling water.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.
We've only got one suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Hi, lady.
Who then?
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
How many are there?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
What! After giving us such a run around...
This one is gorgeous.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
Well, what?
Oh, no... please... not here.  It looks too dangerous.
And how do you explain that?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Yes, maybe that is better.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
It takes even less.
And what about you?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Who knows why they all left...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
Okay. In a few minutes.
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Aren't you going to change?
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
It couldn't be any clearer.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
We'll try again.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
No, not like this one.
And do you remember where she got off?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
Yes, we will.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
You know, I don't love anybody.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Is that possible?
You really must do me this one favor.
Through someone else?
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Who?
Dear Jesus...
It made them holy.
It's not my time of month.
Yes.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Right now?
Oh, I know he does.
In the confessional.
Did it hurt?
And then what?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Martha Louise Livingston.
Not at the moment, no.
Does it bother you?
No... do you?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Where did you go?
No.
No.
I'm always bad.
... makes me...
Her headaches.
And then...
Yes.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Because I'm in trouble.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
Go away, I don't want you here.
No... don't hit me please...
Yes.
And the passage to the barn?
How did she know about him?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Yes.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
Marty, what are you doing here?
What about Roger? He's free.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Who are you?
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Unfiltered.
No-one.
Yes, but I...
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Why do you think that?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
I am not with the Inquisition.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
That possibility never occurred to you?
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
Then help her.
Answers.
What is it?
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Nothing...
No, it reminds me.
I'd love one.
All right?
You think she's a saint?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Why would I lie?
I'm concerned about her health.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Is it because she's a nun?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
The scandal...
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
What happened to the baby?
Shurrup!
Are you now?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
Spoil sport!
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
No. I don't.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
What do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?
You're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.
I'll look in here again.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Well, what happened?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Is it ... is it, really?
Something like that.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
Yes.
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
What?
Lip reading.
Nothing good.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Don't mock the afflicted, Pauly.
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
He's got you worried, then?
Shall I?
Don't be callous.
Like what?
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
Well you're not going.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
No, not me.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it? Is it really?
I knew I could rely on you.
Oh, leave off!!!
Well ...
Aren't we ...
Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
Nerves.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Cattle ranch!
Hell, we're equipped --
Or something will be able to see us.
No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
Looks like a derelict.
Take a look.
What is it, I can't --
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Hard to say.
Yeah!
What?
It grows on you.
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
What?
I hope not.
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Good.
Don't be an idiot.
That's right -- we can't kill it on the ship, but we can at least keep it at bay -- and maybe drive it into the air lock.
I've completely lost their signal.
I'm trying.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
We sure need this flamethrower.
Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
How far?
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Can you see anything?
What is it?
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Let's get moving with this net.
Close...
About four hours.
Yeah?
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
What killed it?
Oh well... you know me.
We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
If we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship --
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Go ahead, Jay.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Let's be democratic.
By eating our food supplies.
Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
I'll get you out of there.
But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Is it dead?
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
What's happening?
And?
Shit.  When?
You win some, you loose some.
Match it!
Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
Yeah?
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
It's alright, it's cool...
Where does that lead to?
Okay.
Sounds great.
What's the problem?
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Looks like it.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
And before that?
Want some?
I... I can't!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
What time's sundown?
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Phoebe.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
Yes. I do.
Eddie...
Just some coffee.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
No-no-no...
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
That's how you met me. In passing.
And too many of them are produced.
Margo.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Being violently ill to her tummy.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Huh?
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
As of this moment you're six years old...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
How is Eve? Okay?
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
That never stopped you before.
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
What's all over?
Who?
Don't mix your metaphors.
Here we go...
Now don't get carried away-
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
Glory Hallelujah.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
The point is - in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade - we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.
What would you like? Texas?
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
Why.
I just asked a simple question.
You didn't have to tell me.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You're quite a girl.
But she just got here...
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Buy some.
Night an' day.
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
My husband...
I'd like that.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
'Remembrance'.
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Why not?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
The heave-ho.
I'm so happy you're happy.
Roughly ten minutes.
Three or four miles...
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
It doesn't matter.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
About what?
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
I just can't believe it.
Check.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
What is?
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Where'd you get all that information?
That was a pity...
That's quite a change of subject.
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
Margo!
I'm a human being, I've got some!
That was way back...
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
What is he talking about?
Where is she?
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I will.
Margo, you haven't got any age.
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
I have no intention of having an accident!
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
What's your being married got to do with it?
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
A couple of weeks.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
--read 'em both and you'll see--
Yeah?
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
--a spy, you mean?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Why didn't we get that?
--you do?--with access to records?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
Facts or theory?
Then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit.
--we will--
--I know, I know--
--has he got an ax?--
--I haven't said anything--
You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Who?
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Maybe we are...
--and the FBI confirms--what more do you need?--
Only everything...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
11:30.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
--yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
I'm so glad.
That's right.
I've got a lot of energy.
I didn't do anything wrong.
When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
--so?
We've just been talking to Young--
--Deep Throat?--
--there's nothing new in it--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
--this'll only take one second--
I'm not your source on that.
Go on.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
Nobody ever had too much.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
You can't believe that.
Lotsa hints--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Anyone but Bernstein.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
When so ordered.
A girl. Melissa.
Sorry.
-- Thanks, coach --
Suck me...beautiful?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
Why is this?
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Ostreicher.
I'm glad you think so.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Yeah right.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Sure.
Of course.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, that's right.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
You fuckin' rule!
I'm not going.
Nothing!
Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
I told you.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Don't you want me to?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Kevin, this is serious!
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
I don't know.  How do you?
Okay.
I love you.
Yeah.
Ready for what?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something.  To make her, you know...
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Observe.
Yeah.  So you want double condiments on that?
I think we're falling in love.
Stifler!!
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
No shit.
Doing what?
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
A cure?
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
And you call me a moron...
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Oh shit... No...
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Why the fuck would I do that?
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
Yes sir.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
You must have.
Come out! I can do alterations.
Yes, your highness.
Now just get off the train.
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
Don't be
I'll never let go!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
You'd lose your security deposit?
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
What do you mean?
Run, Anya -  go...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Remove him at once.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Promise me she'll have her home.
What?
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
It's okay.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
How can you possibly oversleep?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Wisconsin.
I'll getcha a piece.
Don't be funny.
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
You sure?
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
M'hm.
U-huh.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
I dunno.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
I didn't follow you!
Following is different. I was spying.
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Sinatra?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Yeah.
It was just great!
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh! My God! 
What thing?
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Yeah.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
You catch Dylan?
You have a raccoon?
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
It's a narrow view.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Oh, do yuh?
Yeah, I love it there.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Ah, Max, you, uh...
You'll total the whole car.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
And... uh-
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
We're gonna operate together.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
No.
Oh.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
I don't know. I don't know.
Very well.
You should talk to Mr. Joe.
One guess.
Why last?
And you've only just met.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
Of course.
What?
To dander.  Otis.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Really?
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
I love her too, Joe.
Count on it.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
When does he graduate high school?
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Lucy overdosed.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Let me heal you, baby.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Hey!  Would you?
Anytime, sport.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
For good.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
I'll say as little as possible.
You can never be too early or too thin.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Truce?
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
He'll find his way back.
Otis!!!!
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
Hello?  Last birthday was?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't do this.
I have no idea who you are.
I guess.
It's a Calder.
Sure.
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
No you're not.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Well...wow...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
If he were still alive, maybe.
Are you asking me to marry you?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
You don't know she's a bitch.
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
What does that mean?
Thanks.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
I'll be right out.
Would you like to meet my husband?
Hm.
The both of you.
Neither does Joe.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
Well...  I declared war!
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Wait!  When can I see you again?
I'm Princess Bala.
Divinely?
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
You did?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Duty calls!
Uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
So...you two are in love?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Oh, of course --
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
I can't think of any.
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
What do I do?
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Sheldrake?
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Why?
That's me. 
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Good night.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
Would you like to?
Yeah.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
So I see.
Oh.
Eight-thirty!
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I thought so.
Someone from the office.
Baxter.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
He doesn't give a damn about me.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
The dishes?
I don't?
That's very wise.
Of course not.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
That's very flattering.
I don't know.
That's right, Baxter.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Relax, Baxter.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
No I didn't.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Yeah.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Me?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's regulations.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
A.W.O.L.?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Important?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Okay. I'm sorry.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Sssssh.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What gives?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Oh -- oh!
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Well --
Get out --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Sure, thanks.
None.
Sort of.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
Who are you ?
No shit.
I don't believe you --
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Yeah, it is.
Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
... he's an amazing officer.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
Where ?
First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
Signs?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Looks pretty shallow.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
They must have seen the fire.
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
A lame ?
We took them from the dead.  Now -- I assume you want to rest, to shower. We'll attend to your repairs after dinner.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
Who knows.
I met him.
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
I'm Kurtz.
No -- no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
You can't have water after morphine.
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yes, I know...
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
It's a feeling you get in the jungle. When you get good, you can find a track and tell not only how many they are, but their morale, how far they're going, whether they're near their camp, the weapons they're carrying.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
His name is...
I'm sorry to hear that.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
What things?
The river is beautiful.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
175  CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
168  CONTINUED:
Keep back.
Six months.
She's dead.
That's why I left, moved to Washington.  When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly.  Pretty dull.  Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.  We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am.
Why?
Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
-- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
I don't plan on dying.
-- Turn around.
I'm right behind you.
If that means freeze my balls off, no thanks.  I'll be okay.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
You don't know how true that is.
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Nothing personal.
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
What are you talking about?
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Go ahead.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Emergency room only.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
His home number.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
His name?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
You all set here?
No!!! Stay away from me!
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Note. Put it in the note.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Yes.
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Two days.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Welcome.
Fries.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
I had to see you...
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Don't want to. I love you.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
So am I, Frank.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
About a dog.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Think white and get serious.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Well, I can't reach them.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Do you realize that I work at him?
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
Oh, my gosh.
I forgot to lock the door.
So you're from around here?
What is this?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
How long have you been freelance?
I ain't scared of you.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
That's right.
What?
You would be.
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
Sick.  The flu.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
Where are we going?
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
Yes.
Yes.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Why?
How did you get into the business?
The C.I.A.?
Jesus -- why?
Why not?
Tell me about the first time.
I don't know.
Yes.
You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Yes.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Sorry.
Taiwan.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
And you were drilling these holes...?
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
I'm sure you will.
Yes.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Shit.
Okay.
Yes.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Yes.  Please come in.
Holidays are our busiest days.  No one likes to be alone on holidays. I know I don't.
I called because I just want... I need to talk.
Sometimes.
Do you believe that?
It's possible.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
American currency.
I have all day.
Thank you.
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
Can you do the lock on it?
And suppose a little old lady lives there?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Is it gone four-thirty?
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
We don't speak Czech!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Both, see you later.
That bad?
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
You're kidding.
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
Here!
Listen, Doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going.
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
No!
No!
Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
How about you Brutus?
Whatever!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
So, we won't be going to London?
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Great....How long will it go for?
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
We don't need you.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
I'll be okay, just get me home.
I had it coming from someone.
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
It was the biggest I could find.
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
But I have to finish this....
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
What for?
It's time to go home, Holly.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
Can we talk in your office?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Very well.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
And I have no idea why.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
That's over. Way over.
Thanks.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I didn't know either.
Landon --
He wants to talk to you.
Demented.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
Scamming's a strong word.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
What kind of a man are you, son?
Were?
I don't want to have any conversation.
'They won't.'
It's private.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Yeah --
It's not.
And why would that scare me?
When I have something to say.
It means you can do anything.
What are you talking about?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Loved?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
I was twelve.
That what you do?
Better. I was really angry.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I have expectations, too.
Dad --
No. I want what's best for you.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Lead man.
Does it have to do with Jamie?
That won't be possible.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
How -- how long does she have?
Praying.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
Yes. You?
Please.
I'd work backstage or something?
I didn't say you did.
Yeah.
Yes, sir!
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
No!
How are you?
Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
Bic... It's a Bic pen.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
What?
Pro! Release the rope!
Shhhhhhhh!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Precisely! 
You know me?
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
What if you lost your keys?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
I run this place! 
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
She plays the clarinet, too.
No, he showed me one.
Okay.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
What'd you come out here for?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Sure.
I don't know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
I don't care.
Don't ask me.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
He was nervous.
How's he doing?
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I don't blame him.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
No.
Just gimme a chance.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Vanished. Thin air.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
What is it, Tommy?
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
This is so embarrassing...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Everybody okay up here?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Any time.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Why me?
I didn't drop 'em.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Flying to Cambodia.
Perhaps you and I could get together at some point also. \96I'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't know anyone here in this town.
Really?...
...Who is this?
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his \96 what about before that?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
...Who?
What DID you mean?
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust.
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
And what would that be, son?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going \96 don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Don't panic, I'll join you in a minute.  What's you think of Richard and Poppy?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland \96 I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Yes... Isn't it?
Well, you just... sound a little\96
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now \96
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York \96 hopefully our numbers are growing \96 who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths \96 not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories\96
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet \96 what happened to your ear?
Okay, but hell, you should know what it is. I can show you in about thirty seconds.
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started \96 I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me \96 my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Where there's life there's hope.
Well...
What do you mean?
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this\96
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
Lou.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Congratulations.
Must be.
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
Give you nose bleeds?
Only fry you once.
You two have some sick sex thing?
Excellent picture.
Mr. Lipnik, please \96
Did you find out about her parents?
It's been three months.
What was she like in school?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Only when they make interesting reading.
I don't smoke.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
No.
Why not?
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No, thanks.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
What if I call you Nicky?
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine.  How's your back?
Why?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
Of course I knew.
I found Lisa Henderson.
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
How did it end?
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
No thank you.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
Yes I am.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
Somethin', though.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
She killed him.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
He was shot.
The whole thing \96 painting.
What about the shit they write?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
It's in New Jersey.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Yeah, I met her already.
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I don't like beer.
You should talk to him about this.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Not black.
Yup.
Who said that?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
Really?
Yeah..
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve \96 I mean Shenge.
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist \96 she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck \96 I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
About what?
Hi Gina.
Come on in!
Good. What do you have?
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
What who's saying?
It's Monday morning.
Think so?
You mean babies with you?
I don't believe it, Jean \96 they're picking straws.
What's his name?
You only want one Big Mac?
Yeah, it's the best one.
You like your dad's paintings?
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Yeah.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
I will relay the message.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Maybe you're right.
I'm tempted.
Treat to be here.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Nope, I told her everything.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
No, just give you a splitting headache.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
What is it?
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Keep it.
What are you talking about?
Alfred's happy here.
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
Mr. Freeze.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
Maybe he melted.
From the other side of the equator-
I see you knew him.
Well...um...her.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
But he's never said a word-
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Where is my wife?
You lie!
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
The _Rolls_?
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Perhaps the fall...
What?
...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
You understand obsession better than you let on.
That's usually my line.
Well, I met someone...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
And now....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
I don't want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
What are you talking about?
Excuse me.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
How could I forget?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Take me. Let the boy go.
... A hundred and eight?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
That's why I wear a target on my chest.
Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
As far as I know.
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
... Terror.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
I wish you'd...
WHAT?
WHAT??
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Alicia!  Come here, have a seat.  Show Miss Vale why you wear the mask.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
Tom Jones?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
David, I'm serious!
Meaning?
About Charles...
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
oh dear.
Well, Ahm....
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Er ... pray tell me why?
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Sean Connery.
Sure did.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
I am sorry you feel that way.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Nope.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
What?
Yeah, heh heh.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
And Boot-Head.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, really.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Huh? Huh huh.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Where are his pants?
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Yup. Huh huh.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
That's how long you were gone.
No, I'm not putting up with this.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Where are your skulls and bones?
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
Who did the sushi?
Just a hunch.
God, if this is true this is like, amazing!  I kinda like it up here. Can I visit you sometimes?
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Really.  I don't know.
I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
I got an A!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
Now, let's get rolling!
No.  What's wrong?
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
I want to get in.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
... I will.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I'm sorry already.
The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Look at the tiny figures.
I don't know.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
Yes. I think so, too.
Oh, fine.
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, I will.
No, Robert.
In a day or two, yes.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I have no idea...
Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
Yes. Thank you.
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
Yes.
No. I like it here.
Ben is very ill, Eve - I've seen that before.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Hello, Eve.
Yes, so do we.
Thank you, Eve.
That's very interesting, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Yes. It's a very good show.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
Yes, I understand.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
I certainly do.
Yes, it is.  Would you tell me your name again, please?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Yes. That is correct.
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
No, Ben.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Oh, I see.
Yes. I would like to do that.
Hello, Ronald.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Yes.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes.
Yes.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
Compensated...?
I was given meals, and a home...
No, I do not have any of those.
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
But you won't sign, correct?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... Hello.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Nothing.
Try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
Do you need a secretary?
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
Thank you, Colonel.
Okay.
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The monkey.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
What?
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
Me and John.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Shut up!
What's that?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit, yes!
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
Schwartz.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain \93doors\94 which should never be opened.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
I just wanted to say \93hi.\94  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
My tits?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
My God.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I like that.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
Why are you being like this?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
Do you?
Says who?
Do you?
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Mr. Malkovich?
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Whatever.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
Don't pay to complain.
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Thank you.
I will.
In case of what?
Well, what can you do?
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Go upstairs I said!!
Oh I been out.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
It ain't what you think.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!?
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
It's the LeBaron.
Huh.
Why me, man?
No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man.
Come and get it.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Nothing.
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
That is for the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Yeah, but we're--
My rug.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
They were Nazis, Dude?
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
He's handicapped, huh?
Are these.
And was there anything of value in the car?
And what do you do, sir?
And the, uh, the briefcase?
Well I like your style too, man. Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.
What's your drink, Dude?
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
I thought you might know, man.
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
He fixes the cable?
So Dieter has the money?
Uh-huh.
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
But he's--
What the fuck are you--
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
Huh?
What the fuck is going on there?
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Nihilists!  Jesus.
No, I'm--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
The bulk of the series.
Is the car out front yours?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Then what's...
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!
Dude, I'm sorry--
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Shit!
Yeah?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
Are you employed, sir?
Well. . . yeah.
Walter!
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Survival.
Nothing.
Minutes.
Like cancer with a purpose.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Sounds like a plan.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
So?
Thought you were dead.
Too bad you're out of it.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
I don't know about this, man --
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches, paco.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Two so far.
Us?  What are you talking about?
Scud.
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
Just do it, old man.
Don't even start, old man.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Take him.
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
Who is LaMagra?
You're joking --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
Preventive medicine.
There are worse things than vampires out there.
Some. It's been slow --
I've been better --
Deacon brought me back.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
How?
Hey, folklore--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
Closer.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
The Witch's voice.
So whoever built this--
That's a joke?
She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
--scared the living shit out of us.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
I can't.
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--no, I think they're all in there.
Turn the tapes back on.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
Ask me what I don't have.
Butt-ugly owl.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
--Cotter: shut up.
Too busy eating us?
I spend a lot of time on e-Bay. Buying, selling--sometimes buying then re-selling at substantial mark-up, sometimes just selling crap I find in the street.
How's she going to know where to--
Next time try putting on shoes--
What?
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're <u>shook</u>--we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today--
I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
One of the printers.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Rusty Parr had the right idea on child care.
Ah, Domini?
At least you still have the tapes.
Why she kills children.
--no.
Still working on it.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
What'd you say?
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Whatever.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Yeah.
Domini.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
I don't....
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
Yes.
I am?
No, I--
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
...Huh?
I couldn't believe it either...
Abby... you all right?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Abby--
You're bad.
Ray--
What the hell happened, Ray?
...What was that?
Isn't that what you want?
With your gun?...
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
We don't seem to be communicating--
I reckon I can hear him...  ...Room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the TV option.
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
I didn't say that.  Well?
Ya catch any fish?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
Has Ray come in yet?
Right. Sorry.
Right.
What.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
I've seen a few.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
You did? A human ear?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Then, shut up!
Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
I wanted to see you.
Well.
I'll go then.
No. please. I won't.
Don't say that.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Hello.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Do you love me?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
No thanks. what does that mean?
Go where?
Nothing.
There ya go.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
Terrible. boring.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Where are they?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah. Good bye.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
I'll drink to that.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Yeah.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
That's what I thought.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You want to go talk to him?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey!!
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
No.
No Jeffrey!!
uh uh.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
No. No thank you.
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
Um-hmm.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
Motherfucker works fast.
He what?
Five-thousand per kilo.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
You'll see for yourself.
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
What is?
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Yes, I am.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
We want some grass.
It's your grass.
Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
I heard.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Actually, it was three.
It would be my pleasure.
Yes, it is.
Power?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
I'm going to California.
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
What's happening to us?
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I'll be here.
Where are you going?
Swear on my life.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
What?
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
The strike is a success; but ...
I understand. What's your question?
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
Second district ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
It's true.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
Here?
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
Good evening, sir.
A name?
Yes, I believe there won't be any more talk of the NLF for some time.
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
Yes ... But let me first see you.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
But there's more?
A massive cardiac arrest.
I don't think so.  The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Like cats and dogs.
No -- never.
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Sit down, Frank.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Aren't they all?
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Yes.
No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
At a dinner party -- about eight months ago.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
I was angry.
You called him?
No.  No, I don't.
She suffers from severe menstrual cramps.
Chinese peony root.
No.
Then -- those are not your own words?
Yes -- he did.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
He video taped you.
You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
Yes.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It won't be that hard.
Yeah.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
She's mistaken.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
Are you scared?
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
I love you too, Dad.
Why?
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I'll talk to him later.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
No.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
It's not that long.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
He's not coming.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
No, what?
Oh, yes.
I'll get right on it.
Yeah.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Oh! You caught me.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
She starts sniffing me.
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I told you, I love other people.
What made you ask such a question?
Yes! Hi.
No. I was just... No.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Sure.
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
What?
Long day. Go to sleep.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
No one's asking you to!
What about us? What about me?
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
I can't sleep.
I don't remember!
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
So what the hell's the good news?
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Just some flies.
What the hell you talking about?
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Let me see it.
Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Not that I remember.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
No thanks.
That building?
Should I?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Ours!
What we have to do is call the police.
Two point one seventy-six.
The same way you did before.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Why?  'Cause you know him?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
There's no time.
But it could be anywhere.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
What?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Where, then?
I had to.  You made me.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
What are you going to do, V?  Shoot me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't think so.  I'll tell you why.  If you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  If I was you, I would have killed me the minute I brought the money home.  But you didn't and I know why, because you don't want to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you? No, I know you don't.
Where's the fucking money?
Five.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Lick me.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Hey, Mickey.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was so wound up about Gino, she was trying to help me relax.
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
I knew it.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Why?
Basically.
The redistribution of wealth?
Shit, here we go.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
Do you think you know me like that?
Does the case lock?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah.
He does it right in front of him.
He won't.
Trust me, Violet.
If he does ...
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
I want a second opinion.
I'm not asking.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
...it's a problem...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
MPG Capital.
Right.
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
-- sir? --
Excuse me?
I hadn't heard.

You have blood on your pants.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Listen to what you want.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
What?  Like amnesia?
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
No.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
xxxxxx
What?
xxxxxx
Not really.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
My husband's out looking for him.
I'm sorry.
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
xxxxxx
-- I'm on it --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't know.
Thank you.
... have a look.
Got there!
... yer ducts.
... get to it.
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
What do I have to do.
You don't have to sing it.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
Sam, I think I ought to tell you ... I'm afraid she's upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
You remember Alison?
Ah ...
Am I?
Not much.
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
I'm sure you have
He's a freelance subversive?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
We don't make mistakes.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Ah.
No.
Oh, sorry.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Well, all wars do -
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
What?
Who will?
You're joking.
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Oh ... Jesus!
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have \A331.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Information Retrieval.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
What?
Call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
Yes.
What's the matter?
I did it for you.
Sam Lowry.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Yes.
She didn't say anything about it to me.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
What is it?
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Er, yes ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Fixed?
What is it?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
What?
Are you saying this is illegal?
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
No ...
She's having a baby. Twins.
Mary said you might be coming.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
Dead.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
I can't. I have to stay with my patient.
You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
Yeah?
His heart's beating.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I think it looks good.
How is she?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
He'll be all right.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
Frank.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Thanks.
What's wrong.
What's that, Frank?
What look?
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
How's he doing?
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
What?
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
Faster!
Used to be my partner.
No way!
You write this?
And the rule was...
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
It's not loaded.
Oh, God, no!
I'll put her on.
London.  That's a promotion!
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Why?
Yes.
Good night.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Not because you have to.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Then it went well.
Define your terms.
No.
I lost six pounds...
This is important to me.
Sit down, stop.
Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm gonna go look at it again.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Yes.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
It's started.
He said something about...
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
That's okay.
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
I'll speak to you.
They fired me.
No.  Not even you.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
I trust you.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Yes.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
What?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Oh, good.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Well, when?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy.  You want me to talk to him?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
That's yes?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Right back to you.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I just might.
Oh yeah?
I'm going home!
What, right now?
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
What!
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Righto.
Of course...it's wonderful.
It's a...full length life-size figure!
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Here here...
Bye!
That means you like me!
What are you trying to say?
Oh...f-for a long time.  Ever since you first came to the club.
Why not?!
Just about anything, Walter.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
Hm.
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
What are you doing here so early?
Leonard, what are you doing?
I'm totally serious!
Nothing...nothing at all.
Why not?
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I do the research.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
Dead Cat?
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
I don't have another cat!
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
Yeah, why?
It was.
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Yeah I did.
Oh yeah that was Mayolia, she's a nice girl.  She's kind of strange, though.
You're like an undercover guy!
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Walter shut up and relax!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Good morning Walter!
What do you get?
Walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I had him in my grasp.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Litter, yeah!
What's with you?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
You didn't like them.
Would you sleep with them?
Get away from here.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Don't tread on the earth?
Eeyuu.
Yeah?
I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
I... yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
You were having a nightmare.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
I think you've forgotten something.
You guys are thrashed.
Buffy.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Oh, I'm good.  I'm good.  Kind of miss my knees, though.
Not exactly.
Yeah.
Well, I've always wanted to see Oxnard.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Merrick...
You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Yes.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
Lothos.
All right.
It's true.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Your turn.
It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
Vampires of the world, beware.
I can't work this.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
He knows who I am!
I was just scared is all.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Nicole...
I don't understand.
No --
I heard she got straight A's.
Well, I hope so.
Buffy?
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
Run.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Yes I do...
I did.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
We all deserve to wear white.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
What's it say?
He'll learn.
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Annie's a smart lady.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
C ' mon!
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
What?
No.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Crash, shut the door.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
See ya at the yard, Meat.
Can I give you my testimony?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
We're eight and sixteen.
Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
Where does he go?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
What?
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
Was I at that dinner?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Yeah.
All right, take care.
Hold on a second.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Lester...
Help, Daddy!
I don't know.
Matter of fact...
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
Hey.
I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
I lost control?
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
I see you, you motherfuckers.
No, a...
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
It's me.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
All right, we're clear.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
What can I do?
Ace, listen to me.
Oh, no.
Right away. Okay?
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
No, he didn't.
Okay, okay.
No, you don't.
What's it...
He needed some clothes.
Yeah.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
Fuck you!
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
Who were you with?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
What if he won't stop?
Listen to me.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I wouldn't do that...
You get down here!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Oh, you are...
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
That's amazing.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
You're firin' me?
Green?
Can't do it with both hands?
Can you do it with your left hand?
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
I can't.
Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' -
You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be filling out paper work for the next two months because of you and this piece of shit, you...
Hey!
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Yeah?
Now move along.
Here we go!
I did - I didn't -
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
He tries to do everything...
Is that the last one?
Fuckers!
Yeah. Fuck him.
Great!
Carmine's gone.
Calm down! Calm down!
What?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
That's enough now!
Mm.
Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
Okay, Sammy.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
All right?
It's all right.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
Bye.
I don't - 
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
I love you.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
He called you right here.
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
All right.
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Stacy. 
Pleasure.
Nicky sends his warmest regards.
But, hey, what do they care, as long as I keep sendin' money back.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
So are we.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No, no, no, no!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?!
Oh, sorry -
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Having a good time?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
I don't know. I can't remember.
I wonder..
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
What did you think?
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
I'm sure.
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
We'll hunt him down together...
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Winning.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
"Well done," Cactus.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
What did you say?
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
I still have one left...
You can't get away with..
Men, huh?
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Enough.
Actually, yes.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Not too cool...
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
You could've killed us.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Why would I do that?
Yes sir.
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
What do you keep making me out to be?
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Allow me.
Give me 20 minutes at least.
Will you let me explain!
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I don't believe you.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Shit!
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
How much time do you have left on it?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Sometimes I paint.
Pictures.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
That makes two of us.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
That's not her.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
You're going to let them get away with this?
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
A typical fuck-up.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Naturally.
Only one way to find out.
That's not good enough.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Stay there.
You'll see her.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
I thought you'd know me by now.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
How?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
What would you call it?
What do you think his name is?
Hi, Jimmy.
Persistent.
An excellent quality.
Ask him yourself.
Who the fuck is he?
Fucking mad!
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
What?
Bloody right I do...
Must be.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
They're jealous.
Must be.
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Tell me about him.
You say that like a gentleman.
Didn't think I could.
Is this an obsession of yours?
Something I heard someone say once.
All the time.
Shut up.
Ask to meet me again.
Sorry.
Only if you kiss me.
Why, honey --
More than that.
No.
I promise.
What?
I'm going home!
You knew my Jody?
You knew my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
He asked me to see were you all right.
Got to be somewhere.
I like you, DIl
Whatever you say, Dil.
Tell me what she wore.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Need to lose myself awhile.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
He's all right.
Someone's got to do it.
He's hot.
Suits you.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
Definitely unusual.
How is it a farce?
So, what do I look like?
I can smell her perfume.
No. It's the truth.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
I didn't even fancy her.
No.
What the fuck were you doing here?
Why did you sign up?
The fastest.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Present tense, please. Love her. Whatever she is. I'm thinking of her now, Fergus. Will you think of her too?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
Stop it --
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Tell me something, anything.
Why?
The fastest.
What you say, faster?
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Nice lady.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Let's look anyway.
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Then who did? You're the only one left.
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
You lied to me so many times --
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Oh, I see.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
Agents.
Who?
No.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
But no one actually saw him die.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
You'll wreck your raincoat.
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Then who does?
I'll take that.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
There, you said it.
Cutting it out.
You did.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Why?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No --
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
I dare you.
Shut the door!
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
It's a start, anyway.
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Go on.
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I'm afraid it is important.
What's its value today?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F\E9lix -- are they for sale now?
Here's ten.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
And then some. If you'd only told us you was goin' to her room we could've kept 'em busy --
I don't know anything.
Leave me alone -- !
Stop it!
I don't know. I suppose so.
I don't know.
I don't know.
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
I'm Regina Lampert.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Starting tonight?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Where?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Because I don't love him.
Don't you want me to stay?
Didn't Charles have any friends?
How can you tell?
Oh la vache!
What's the matter, ch\E9rie?
What?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Are you sure?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
No?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
I knew you were a pervert. Always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
You think you're my sister?
Why?
You eventually have to talk to him.
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
OK. increase the peace.
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
I did.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
Sharon's far from a slut.
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
Pretend we're just another couple.
Hi princess.
Yes?
You can ask me anything.
That's what he said.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
The library. I'll be fine.
You didn't believe her?
People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
I'm worried about someone.
Hi Sandy.
If sheep don't count.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
ROD!
Okay, okay.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.

...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.

...and a shitload of ice.
...-tana.
I need your help.

Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
That dog was mean before I met him.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
What the hell's goin' on?
 Excuse me...

Oh, man.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
I did not steal this truck!
That's...
Doesn't work.
...-ed.

 Yeah...
Back up!  Back...

You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Oh, shit.
Goddamn!
Oh, shit.
Come on!
Left, left, left!
Come on, old...
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
 Shit. 
Come on.
These'll keep it cold.

I'm a dangerous man!

Then stay...
Okay.  Okay.

 All right.  Hey.
Worth a try.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
...miles.
Yeah, baby!
Hey.   Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
...man.
You all right?


Huh?

What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
Reach into my pocket.
 Okay.
Okay. 

 That's why I didn't give it...
Whoo!
 

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?
Hold this. 

Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!

Excuse me.  I got a bullet in my leg.
Who drove the ice cream...
Who had to put a gun to your head?
Thank you.
Arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
Three seconds.  One...
And it won't be pleasant. 
Hey!
Mason, you have to take this...
You-You can't let him...
...-lem too?
He's the dude...
Thank you.
However, you are also non-en-...
In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
Is it--?

This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work...
No!
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've...
Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...
All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
We're in.
Check it out.
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
That's right.
...time to time, yeah.
Odd, then, that his car...
Elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  Get yourself some CDs.


You'd never understand!
...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Go.

INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...try this one out some-...
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...is death.
Some people might.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
...tunnel!
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
You redneck idiot, do you have...
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...


INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Take it easy, Jake.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
So anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the Chinese do?'
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
It doesn't hurt.
Do you know him?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Maybe.
My daughter.
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
Yes... I think I can manage...
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Oh, my, yes.
Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Curly, where's your car?
Jake, listen.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
How are you, Lou?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
Yeah?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Matter of fact I do.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
I said I'll drop it.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
How did you find out?
Why?
Did you have affairs?
Did he know?
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Of course I'm sure.
Is that unusual?
They can't be.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
...A flaw...
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You saw my fa... father? When?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
You bastard.
...That's not what I meant.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
Katherine.
...so that's why you hate him...
With us.
I'm all right.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Oh no.
A Miss Sessions calling.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will. Dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  That's news.
Yes?
Si.
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Who?
I'm afraid so.
...Yes of course.
But...
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Yeah.
He's not in, Mr.?
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yeah.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
They're all a bunch of phonies.
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
No, you have a press agent do it.
She ran away?
Well, you never know, do you?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Fifty lire... 
Progress! It always arrives too late!
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
OK...
The food is marvelous in Cuba the senoritas are beautiful stop I could send you prose poems of palm trees and sunrises and tropical colors blending in far off landscapes but don't feel right in spending your money for this stop there's no war in Cuba regards Wheeler.
Thais.
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
I know.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
I'm going back there.
It didn't end very well, did it?
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Who said anything about brooms?
Yes.
September the ninth?
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Hello, Bernstein.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
Ask them to sit down.
There is no news big enough.
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Charlie, please don't -
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Can't say, sir.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Charlie!
Look out that window.
Go ahead.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
You won't be lonely, Charles...
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Well, thanks a lot.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Am I sure?
You're shittin' me.
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Do you mind if I drink this here?
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Can I join in?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
No, this is great.
There's no light back there.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
I can't believe you're here.
What?
There's more, isn't there?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
What about Sing?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Who doesn't?
What happened to the walk and the nakedness?
What time was this?
Nobody. It was closed.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
In a second!
I'll assess all I want!
So I'm told.
What's your point?
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
Yeah.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Hey man, I hear Caitlin's marrying an Asian drum major.
Go open the sore.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
That's cheating?
She called you Brad?
Your mother.
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
You know what I just watched?
Return of the Jedi.
There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
All of them.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
You know what pisses me off the most?
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Gatorade.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
No, you're not.
One night only. She's buried in the morning.
If you go, I go.
Bible truth.
Yeah sure. You're so repressed.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Why should I loan you my car?
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
And this is what you rented?
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
Fuck you.
Shut the fuck up!
What are you talking about?
What responsibility?
As if it's that easy.
Oh, like your life's any better?
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
I don't think so.
They are not.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
No, she's getting married.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
One seventy-nine.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
It's not my store.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
We were going to start again, I think.
Veronica.
Lasagne.
Maybe.
She's my girlfriend.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Three including you.
You!
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Why do you say that?
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I'm going to class.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Because going down it's a big deal! I used to like a guy, we'd make out, and sooner or later I'd go down on him. But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
He's your cousin?
No way.
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
You'll be missed.
How long you gonna be here?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
How yo doin', Gabe!
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'.  You sound like a mother hen.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Hey, fuck you.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
There wasn't time for anything else.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Give him the money.
Okay--I don't know about this.
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Patience my love, patience.
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
We spent a night there one night...
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
I don't expect you to understand.
Why are you yelling?
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You got to go back now!
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
For the same reason you did, to help.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Get it!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
Forget it!  I refuse!
RUN, DAMMIT!!
Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower.  So far, no sign of anyone.  Looks like a phoney call. Over.
It looks like a winding route.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Who's going with you?
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Ask the questions.
There, what's that place?
What about it?
He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
Good morning, Walt.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Good evening.
Help me, sir?
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
I did, sir.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Keeping fit then?
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what he is... he... he rents your room. Alex confronts Joe.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Yes!!!
Fine. Fine.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Oh.
Yes.
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Travel...and things.
Most of the time.
Just had one.
When was the last time you took one?
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
I'm...fine.  Fine.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
Oh, my, yes.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Federal?
Can you finish on schedule?
So?  It was a random thing.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Pick me up in five minutes.
What am I gonna do with flowers?
Jesus, what is with this guy?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Oh.  Sorry.
Twenty-four minutes.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You're cool.
Two...
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What?
It's a mess.
Tonight it is.
Yeah, like that...  But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  Everybody dies.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
I'm not catching a melody.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
You'd do her a favor.
Jazz.
Doesn't cover everything.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
We've both run out of options.  If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
What'd they do?
None of your business.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Any special reason?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Mississippi?
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
Motive?
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Yeah.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Believe you about what?
Surprise me.
Who?
Never heard of him.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
How is it possible?
How'd he die?
What?
Jerry, I --
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Where are we going, Jerry?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You saw me standing alone ...
You knew just what I was there for.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Could you be a little more specific?
You've never seen her run.
I'm leaning toward no.
A dog bit it.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Terminal?
You do recognize it then?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Agent Lowry?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
What the hell does that mean?
Wait --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
What do you mean?
I don't think so.
Ellie?
What?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
I'm willing to take that risk.
You're --
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
Meaning...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Thank you?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Well --
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
It's a civilian facility.
You want to classify prime numbers?
I can't move any smaller.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
The librarian... or the library...?
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
The systems integration site.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
If you came back.
Something like that.
You're willing to die for this.
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
I'm sorry.
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
Hi.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Ellie... if you go out there like this -- if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didn't actually happen -- I'm afraid they really will crucify you.  Please.  For your own sake, for the sake of the world... tell them what you know to be the truth.  Tell them it really happened.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Git your shovel and git to work.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I'll make it a dollar.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
That's good: he earned it.
He's probably a gigolo.
Git to work!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
I'll give you fifty cents.
Pair'a nines.
'Bout two hours left.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Back at it in the mornin'. Just need a little nap...
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
That's it. That's the end.
Like an elephant.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
On my own.
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
Call.
Cuter.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
That's all there was. Listen. Open your eyes. Stop beatin' it. And stop feedin' off me. Now get out of the way. Give me some air.
None of your fucking business.
What did I do?
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
When was that?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
What Friday?
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
You know I can't do that.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
No.  Not yet.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
Hello, Ruben...  So that's that...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
They get fan letters...
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
Well, thanks.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
What else?
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Tell it to your shrink.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
Yessir.
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
You're damn right I do.
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
And her husband? What was he?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
It is?
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine.
No. But when he's in that car...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Are we imagining it?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
I can drive.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
It's not the police. It's the Department of Transport. Internal politics. It's a joke. They have no idea who we really are
You could get your wish at any moment.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I did this already.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
I'd have to see it on.
Truly.
Do you think I should?
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
Oh, no, of course not.
I know.    I know.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Wow.   Congratulations.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
When did you start smoking?
It's good exercise, Mom.
Not even if it's something positive?
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
I guess so. I think that's right.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
By color.
You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
So are you engaged, or what?
It's magic.
The left one.
Good God.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Your family just met me.
Do you?
But I do.     I love you, too.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
Shhhh.
I'll see you tonight.
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
I guess so.
Letty, please.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
I don't feel like going to work today.
Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
So, what do you say, Let?
No, no.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
No.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
You killed her!
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
Listen, we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
It's Elvis...
You're there now?
What?
It's Daniel.
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
No thank you.
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
Half the tapes.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
I'm not any closer than you are.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I think he's already figured that out.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
What'd you get?
Can I trust you, Sami?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
How much?
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hard to say.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
What'd they take?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
I can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
I see.   A master criminal.
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
We've got to get out of here.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Me?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
Get in the car.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, I dig him.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
Watch this.
Where is it, Sophie?
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
Thanks.
Tonight.
Take a nap.
You ask a lot of questions.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
No.
It's not your fault.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
A little?
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I do as I please.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
You're probably right.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Kneel!
Jen!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give it back.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
It has.  How's business?
I left the training early.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Who ever made that.
Annie, I need a file.
I knew that.
Don't thank me.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
How 'bout the morgue?
You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
It can't rain all the time.
Who?
Mister Funboy lives there?
I think he's yours, now.
In a better place.  I hope.
I went to see a friend of mine.
Take the dope, too.
That's ancient history.
You don't even remember...
Another jolly nickname?
Magic.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Your pain ends now.
Shelly?
Very well, it's your ass.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
That's right.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
Why are you being so dramatic?
That's a matter of opinion.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Give me the fucking letter.
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Why not?
It's my house.
Give it up.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
How about tonight?
Yes.
What?
How was your date?
Wait, don't hang up.
Okay.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
Why are you doing this?
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
It was perfect.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
It was nothing.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
I don't know.
No.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Is it me?
Good night Cecile.
I know.
Same time next week?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
It works a little.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Who told you?
I told you to lock the door.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
I'll be in touch.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
Ronald?
No.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
What?
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Shut up and turn to page 64.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
I hate it too.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
It was... Fantastic.
Mock, mock, mock.
No, I'm not.
I've never done this before.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
And if I don't?
How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I need to talk to Annette.
We played backgammon?
I did?
Excuse me?
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Nope.
You bastard!
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
What do you mean?
How?
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Oh, lots of times.
Are they nice?
But it's already come true.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Irena.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
What do you mean?
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
That darn kid. I never in my life expected her to get an A in arithmetic. Math's is a practical science --- if she understands figures, she's well out of her own world of make-believe.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed \97 but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, I did.
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
This is more fun than just pretend.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
That's the clever way to do it.
Oh, I suppose it was to the wind you sang, or maybe to the sun, or the clouds, or maybe it was to the flowers in the garden.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
Will you come soon?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Who is she?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Don't you hear it?
Yes...yes, that's true.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
And Amy mailed them?
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
We'll see that she gets there in good time
Nearly four.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
So don't look in his eyes.
You're just saying that.
Frida, grab that red one.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
I still thought it was a purse.
No you don't, believe me.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
He's been here all night?
Why not? There's been a murder.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
No.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
So what do I do?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I guess you'll find out.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Well, whattdaya think?
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
I really gotta pee.
I didn't have to pee then.
Yes I do have to pee!
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Yeah right... You better go.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Take your shower.
Yes, that's what we're looking for.
I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
Very well then. Is that all?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
Oh my god, by wolves?
Briefs.
Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
Okay, you busted me.
No. I was doing my laundry.
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better?
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Okay.
Thanks.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
No, take it.
You got a dog?
Take some allergy medicine.
He's been running money for the Mafia.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
I told you she was innocent.
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
This one walk you home too?
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
What makes her think that?
What of?
The other one?
He tried to kill me!
You are mistaken.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
How could you have been so stupid?
I didn\EDt requisition a secretary.
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
What is going on?
No.  Have a look.
Yes.
You seem restless.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
Yes.
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
I'm...  being...  punished.
What the hell is this ?
Alan
Great.
I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Yeah.
TilT we figure something out.
Up and around?  Soon?
What about containment, Alan?
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Just what you think I mean.
Why would they do that.  They hired me.
So what do we do?
Extend things?
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm not sure... I might have.
A teleprompter.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...'  Hand on the heart...
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
He's not.
Perceptual?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Certainly.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
What do you mean?
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
No.
I had a feeling.
First thing they teach you at the academy.  `Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
No... They don't kid.
The Vice-President...
Well...
No thanks.  It's not that far.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
Anybody would have done it.
I don't know.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
I know.
It was inspirational.
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Hi.
It's nice.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
Maybe. We'll have a little talk first. Then....maybe...I can help you out. String him up.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Come on.
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
I know you can. Like I said, we been watchin' you.
You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Datura.
Forever, darlin'. Forever. 'Til he turns ta dust and blows away on the wind.
Ain't no place safe.
The hospital? 
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
We got a boat.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Knox Overstreet.
Hey, this is great.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yep.
Except sex.
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
What?
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
That's not my fault.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
The pleasure is mine.
You are?  She's glad I called!
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Huh?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Then come with me.
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
"We went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." Anybody want to read?
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
YAWP!
A crazy madman.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Don't stop!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
You have another choice.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
I'm sorry, Neil.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
That's miles.
I... I just don't want to come.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
A play, dummy.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
As far as I'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
What is that supposed to mean?
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
No thanks.
I'll come to the performance.
Yes.
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Who asked any?
You're going to have to get a new one.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Did you clear this?
Just trying to get to my boat...
Jesus Christ lady...
Keep tasting...
Not like him.
Right...
So?
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Joey...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Where is everybody?
Nowhere...
You want some too?
Like Mamooli's country...
Hey! Come out here!
Hey! You hear me? Come out!
What is it man?
I know...
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
You're full of shit!
Yeah.
I know, but...
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Vince thinks... you know...
I know! I fuckin' know!
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Married?
You mean...?
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
Where? Where is he?
Yeah.
Where is he???
Everybody love Linda.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Yeah?
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Psst. Vince!
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Here.
Biederman, yes.
Oh... You know...
Linda, Linda...!
Would you?
I don't know.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
Right here.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
There's Vince!
Yeah.
I don't think about the shot that much.
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
Hell no!
Merle --
What else?
I'm doing that too.
Okay, okay!  Okay. Okay, you're right... What about Sal?
Then lemme have 'em.
That's my plan.
See you Monday.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Listen, Nick --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
No.
No.
Never one.
Sure.
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Up.
Technothugs?
Wade's here.
What did you say?
Avon Lady!
No, you're not model material.  Anything else?
Fuck you - fuck you.
Prepare for a change in lifestyle.
Put that on your political resume.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
And I want Doucet.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
Where?
We have to talk.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
We're partners, aren't we?
...What are you talking about...?
...Have you been drinking?
I'm signing off.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
They always are.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
My granddad was a policeman.
Jabez! Careful --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
I didn't.
That's my problem, Belle.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And serve him right!
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
I did not, Grandma.
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
No, Stone!
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Look here now--
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Ten throws it is.
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Thanks, Mr. Webster!  To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster!
Morning, Jabez.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Ahem -- Neighbor Stone, we want--
Camomile tea!
Dan'l Webster is coming to my party.
You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted.
Well -- yes --
Coming.
Who is it?
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
We can still use my butter money.
Not all of it?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Jabez ...
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
All right, son -- if it helps.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
It's all right, Sheriff.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
I won't forget.
You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
You can talk to me ...
But meant her moving here.
So, why didn't you come?
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.  They're paying for it, so don't be shy.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
What does he want?
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
Who are you, then?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
I'm an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane. And now that I'm moving up to kidnapping, you should be more polite.
Oh...Where does he live?
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
Sure.  It's unnerving.  I remember this one particular married woman, she went out the door so fast there was practically a jetwash...I mean, talk about your wind chill factor...
Don't I always?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Thanks...partner.
I still feel like shit.
Roy?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
How do you know?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
No.  I never smile any more.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Well, how'll I get home?
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
What trip?
Shit...
That's good then.  You've found something.
Do you still want the operation?
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
I can't talk to him.
I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
I'm not alone.
Call me whatever you want.
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
They were ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
What else?
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Give me the keys...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
If you take anybody, please take me.
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
I'm sorry.
Yeah?
What now, Sonny?
I'm glad it's okay.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
No, not until after they killed him.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
All right ... send them the guard.

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Yeah ...
Okay.
Okay, Sonny.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
It's my mother.  Who needs this shit?
What can he do, he's clean...
They're beautiful ...
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Maybe...
No!
I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people ... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk! How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me?

I can certainly think of one more!
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
I was a musician.
We dated off and on for two years. But life on the road is tough. The pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.

So, in other words, you are not down.
You a troublemaker?
What?
You the man.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.
Too long!  Too long.  Now for the life of me, I haven't been able to figger this out.  Either dem Koreans are geniuses or we Blacks are dumb.
No!
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
It's gonna be hot today.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Yo, I'm gone.
What are you so worked up about?
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
I'm getting paid...
Yeah, me too.
Whew!
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Run it then.
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
OK.  OK.
When?
Meda.  Meda.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
I am a man.
Later.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
What?
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
That's what I think.
I understand.
Forget it, Mookie.
I know.
I like Mookie a lot.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
Tell Vito.
That's gonna be the last time you hit Vito.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Yeah, I think.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
In the new library there.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Heddo Jeth-ica.
Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Okay, what?
No, I'm fine thanks.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I know I am, Mom.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
Is that what I think it is?
Cool.
Why not?
It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
The second R is silent.
Who's Captain Rob?
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
What?
You're not my real dad.
Shut Up! Buttlick!
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
And he invented fire.
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
You can't marry my mom.
HARRY!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
A blimp.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
Put a fork in me Harry, lets get started.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
Roger that, Wilco.
Damn! What are the odds?
Try one in a million!
No.
One phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'll talk to you later.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
I know, you want go for a ride.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
Let's just do it and get out of here.
You were born free and free you should remain.
Skateboard.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
He passed away three years ago.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
We start our own class?
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
What does Leto say, Piter?
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
I'm sorry Gurney.
My Lord?
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
Excellent!
 Where are my feelings... I feel for no one...
I'm ready.
I can't... I can't.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
No.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... Do it!
I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER  Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control?  You know when people speak the truth?
Stop him, Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Huh?
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Don't you bave a car?
I have no next picture.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
Who do I play?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
No hospital.  Just take me to the couch...
Mmph?  Where am I?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Really?  I don't feel so great.
I don't know.  Where?
What do you mean?
These shoes are itchy.
I guessed.
Isn't he?
Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
You got the job?!!
You met Basil Rathbone!
I thought he was dead.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Of course I'm here.  Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
You could say that --
Would that work?
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Yes?
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
We're escaping!
Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
Who?
Uh, yeah.  Our picture.
There's still a sex-change --
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't wear angora sweaters, did he??!
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Oh, hi.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Okay?
STOP!
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Dynamite --
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
The <u>Ghoul's Wife</u>?!  God, I can't believe I'm doing this...
I don't know.
Hey, don't blame me!  You didn't say anything about no motor when I was up on that ceiling!
So how long have you known Eddie?
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
I do.
NOOOOO!!!
And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
What if--you're vomiting?
Al!
Al!!
Went --
I'm moving out.
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
What?
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Excuse me.
Cool.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
Thank you. Can I see her?
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Right.
Oh.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Mm.
Oh my God!!
I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
Mom?
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
But Al is your husband now!
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Shari, Ray feels --
What are you talking about?
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Never would be plenty.
You batted or you bunted?
So maybe this is my dynamite.
Right.
Okay ...
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
What?
Ohh...
Really? 
Come on, let's go.
...yeah?
Everybody's someone.
It's nice.
What are you drunk?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
What?
Screw off.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Yeah?!
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
What's the dif --
Great.
It's me, Ed.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
You brought the cameras here!
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
What?... Why?
Yeah. Why?
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
Hey, that's super
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
As far as I know, they--
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
Why are you lecturing me?
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
Uh-huh.
Oh yeah, you bet.
Door was open.
Oh.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Still clear?
We'll let it run awhile
Yeah.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
I also like bananas.
Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
And 290 "disregards," right?
I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
So?
I know.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Till 19-fucking-70.
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
That simple, huh?
This business, Captain?
Call me Dudley.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Of course... But how?
How'd you get them to retract?
What work?
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Let's just kill them.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
At least not anymore.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Against your code?
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Clean?
I never truck with no sissies!
Believed what?
Dogs got no reason to live.
I don't own no shotguns.
They shot him in his library.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And now you'll provide them.
<u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
Okay.  I'll do it.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What?
Give me a minute, will ya?
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
You make a mistake?
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
What?
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
None.  Call it a hunch.
When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
Sid, how are they hanging?
I just called it.
Something like that.
And no one'll know about this?
Showbiz.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Maybe you bumped into someone who took it and you didn't even know.
Listen--
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Be careful, Danny.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Told by whom?
Who was that other guy?
You're crazy.
Yeah.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
They're spooks.
Look, my wife is understandably--
I didn't use my name.
Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
How do you know so much?
Looks like Detroit.
Yeah.
Why?
Those are Feds.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if we just fucked with 'em?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Well then who can?
Oh my God.
You got any money?
Is that good?
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
Daniel's life is already ruined. Maybe if you guys stopped thinking about yourselves for a change and--
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
What kind of trouble.
No.
No, sir.
Not that I could see.
To buy lingerie.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Just for the criminals.
I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us.
I saw a man die.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Yes.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I don't believe it is, no.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Yes.
Other than me.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
It's not me?
Yeah.
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Merry Christmas, son.
Mr. Dean--
Where's mom?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
The blender?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Jesus.
You're tired.
Go fuck yourself.
Yeah.
He got hit by a bus.
I honestly don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
He had help.
Sir--
You're kidding me.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
Do you have visual?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't care to bargain.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
As the wife of one of our party.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
I believe you still have my book.
That makes it harder still.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
No.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love\85and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Don't do this.
No.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
Still a car.
What?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and\85  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Count Laszlo de Alm\E1sy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
Right.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
No.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Are you Hana?
Where've you been?
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I liberated it.
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
Is there a song you don't know?
Very true!
Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
Oh really?
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Because I'm a nurse.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
I've been told that before.
Would you like me to?

I've met you before.
Yes, for your hair.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
He can't even move.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
A bit of one.
Go away.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Why?  Are you German?
Then you were married?
Through a window.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
Exactly.
Why didn't I think of that?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
We're getting close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'm in the middle.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
I'll call an ambulance.
So what?
You can't.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
We're only going one way.
I never carry...baggage.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
We're doing this together. We're partners.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
Let's just see how we do.
It was a long time ago.
A dozen times.
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
Little celebration before we set off.
Yes, you can.  You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Got it.
Behind you.
There is no big job.
Get the hell in.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
My job, my rules.
Transfer.
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
Feeling old?
Charged.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
But--
What about you?
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
You gave them the eight billion.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Because I never assume anything.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Yes it does.
It's those files you asked for.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
You're a lawyer?
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
Five million dollars.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Excuse me?
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Don't bother.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
What, you think I'm made of money?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
They skipped that step.
Jesus.  I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
Really?  It makes me sick.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Uh-huh.
Erin --
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.
There's more than one kind?
Have you been to the water board?
How come you're not eating?
I don't know.
Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
In the conference --
We'll see.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
I do.
You got a little girl?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Better safe than sorry.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
What's going on?
Have you been logging on?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
What?
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
You won't.
Growls a reserved greeting.
What's wrong with him?
Okay, okay.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his \D2right on!\D3
Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Or you ran into something ....
What is it?
Would you please stop calling me that?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
No lightspeed?
You're going to attack them?!!!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Who's staring?
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
Thanks to you.
Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'm sorry too.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
Not really.
You're part of the mining guild then?
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
That sounds familiar.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
What are you talking about?
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
That is why you fail.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
It is the future you see.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
I'll die first.
No! .... Never ....
Never.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
They suggested oranges.
We know that.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
Believe what?
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
They look pretty docile.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
What's the little black box do?
Having second thoughts?
So what does this thing do?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Where?
Who?
The what?
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
What the hell is this?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
...Perceval!
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I will not.
So be it, to the death.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law.
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Your mother told you that?
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
--Nothing!
I will run.
That I cannot.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
One land, one king! That is my peace!
To kill and be king, is that all?
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I see, your excellency.
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Hi, how'd your day go?
Oh great, anything else?
Why don't you let me?
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
Me too.
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
What's her name?
I just heard them Karl.
Yes, I go now.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
What man?
Yes, I think so.
And those lies she's been telling?
Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
No I didn't know you had one.
No.
He didn't mention her.
You could do it yourself...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
No.
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
In Europe.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Oh............
The closet
Here I'll show you.
Captain Howdy.
He's nice.
You like him.
Your not gonna marry him are you?
But you like him.
Well I heard differently.
Honey it's to help you.
Damien Karras.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
That's good.
Oh, Christ.
I stole it.
Stealing is a sin.
You might loosen the straps then.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Uh Huh.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Bon Jour.
Holy water.
How's your leg?
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
In the face of the enemy.
And the son of iniquity be powerless to harm her.
Defender of the human race...
Only what I read in the papers.
I once did a paper on it
Sick priest, is that it?
Very much.
That's to bad.
O'Lord hear my prey.
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
Sometimes.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive!
Your pay.
We don't need you, Frankie.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball.  I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you. I love both you guys, you know that. You're class.  But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.
Swimming trunks.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
They're falling out.
How will he eat?
No bones?
No.
Oh.
Go fuck yourself.
Two nights.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Like an angel.
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Try the black Knable.
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
So do I.
I don't gotta go.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
It's me.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's not family.  It's business.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Talk.
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
She'll get here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
Yeah.  Something.
Yeah, fine.
So what do you think?
Thanks, but I've got plans.
A few bars!
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
No, you take the right.
Yeah.
No, that's your problem, Frank.  You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Because I can hear it.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
February?
Yeah.
You always threw up.
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
You could've come.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Just until we find another girl.
Twenty-eight years.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Later.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
Right.
We're finished.
We ran long.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
That's the premise.
Where's my name?
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Do I look like I'm naked?
What's wrong with it?
Big feet.
Uh... good.
Right.
They're nines.
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Great.
Tell her.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Forget it.
Uh, well ...
Uh ... thanks.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
He doesn't bite.
Downstairs.
For a while.  She left.
Not for money. With my mother.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
The Stratford.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Every year.
It's okay.  Last one.
In and out.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Long story.
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
You don't pick your brother.
So how's the cat food business?
Hi.
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Losing his teeth.
Wow.
Why not?
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
How old is he?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Let me have a look.
A few blanks?  Like what?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
We need to talk.
Something good?
And you wouldn't be.
Never mind that!  Just take Jamie and get out of that house.  Don't tell anyone where you're going -- especially not him -- just GO.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
Don't hang up ...
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Jon, what is it?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
He'd see that a mile away.  The only person he'd talk to about that bomb is his brother.  Unfortunately, turnips can't talk.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Five seconds.
Shoot him!
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Get rid of them.
What happened?
Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
What do you know about it?
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
So you see, I'm not going anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs with you ...
-- Studying.
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
Her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
Excuse me?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody\92s here.
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
I\92m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Sure.
Don\92t you think that\92s a little gimmicky?
Is it...?
She wants to have an affair with me.
So could you write down her exact address?
It wouldn\92t really be cheating...  It\92s complicated.
It\92s your birthday? Today?  What\92s your name?  Where were you born?
We bowl together. We\92re bowlers ...we won a championship...we\92re winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
The Caddy?  Why don\92t you take your own damn car!
I\92ve got all the time in the world...
Me?
What?!
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It\92s by nature an impermanent thing.
It\92s lovely...
I don\92t think so, thank you...
Need a nurse?
Are we what, Jack?
Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Look, I don\92t know what\92s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
Maybe you\92re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Okay, chief.
What are you talking about?  It\92s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
You mean don\92t go at all? What about my internship?
What?
Because that\92s where I live.
Party?  Oh no, I can\92t go to a party...
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don\92t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Telling my mother she doesn\92t have to stay with the kids.
Uh huh...
Well that\92s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
That is the general idea, yes...
She got those shoes...
I can\92t believe it\92s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could\92ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Surprise.  We\92re pregnant...  Yeah...that must\92ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
That\92s why I work for Big Ed?
I want it...
No, open it...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it\92s light out.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
I\92m out of the doghouse?
I don\92t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We\92ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Don\92t worry about it, Jack...
Not with what they pay me...
Jesus, Jack...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Where is he?
Okay, I\92ll take them...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
This makes five.
He's made a few changes.
Victor's better at these things.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Got it, teach.
Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Go back to the drawing board.
Just get back soon, or I start looking for a new groom.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
What do you mean "complete"?
Ben, are you there?
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
I can go hotter!
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
So are you!
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
I think that thing is Ben.
Dude.  That's my sister.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
And if he's not...?
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Ben did this.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Never better.
Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
Great minds think alike.
You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
What?  What do you mean you --
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
You <u>were</u>?
Why didn't you say something?
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Oh, I think you already have.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
The less time, the better.
Message to Proteus.
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
The Other Side got to him.
Brain injury.
It's only for an hour --
That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
You may learn to like it.
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Quite a piece of plumbing.
They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
How are you, Miss Peterson?
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
That line was tampered with...
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Uh -- what?
We're losing pressure in the Flotation Tanks. Check the Manual, right over there.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
I could use a lawnmower...
Was there any damage?
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I don't know. Few munce.
...What're you talking about?
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Personal matters.
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
End a April.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, he's adorable.
I unnerstand.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Oh, yah?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Uhn.
Yeah!
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Yah, right -
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
...Who they playin'?
We might be innarested.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
2:30.
Yah.
Yah.
The heck d'ya mean?
Look, Jerry, you're not sellin' me a damn car. It's my show here.  That's that.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
No, I didn't...
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
I always liked ya so much...
Anyone else residing there?
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Still missing. We're looking.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
They're real good.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah.
I love you, Norm.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
Right, right.
He was killed in action.
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Practicing what?
A year?  How'd you manage that?
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Should we?
Really?
Nothing.
Chloe's dead.
... A person.
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
I'm begging you.  Get on the bus. Get on the bus.
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Who do you think I am?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Pardon me?
This is how we fill up our lives.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
Hum.
Any historical figure.
Good answer.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
No, I'm not...
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Homework assignment.
What?
Wait a minute...
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
What about them?  They're lunatics.
I'm not going...
If you know, I know.
This is not about martyrdom.
Green?  Did you say green?
What?
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
... no, no, no...
What?
Maintenance.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
There is no money.
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Please, God, no...
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
No, please, no, God, no!
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
I...I...
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Blow me.
Yeah, you should have specified.
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
Hey, don't be knockin' the Chevette.
Sure.
I know, honey.  I just --
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
Yeah?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
Like... 4:25.
No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Don't do it! Don't do it!
No! No! Don't!
I don't.
That's a plan.
I know who you are.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Read you.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Powerful warrior.
Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
About 22 hours on site.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
American.  Come to get you out.
De Fravio.  Dave De Fravio. Lieutenant... Air Force.
I could take it or leave it.
That's it.  My life.
But now it's free, right?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
You threw him out?
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
Do I look like I have someone special?
Meeting ... people.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Got any more bread crust?
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
I was attacked.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
What does that mean?
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
Thanks.
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
I... I was just leaving.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
You can ask.
Fine.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Yes.  They're free.
How much?
Tonight!  How's tonight?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
I don't know.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Who are you talking to Jack?
Bingo!
What?
Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
You don't have to say that.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Twinky?
A wig?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
No, dammit, I would easy.
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I hope they do.
You treat me like I was.
What the hell is that?
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
It brings out my eyes...
What?
I don't, huh?
Palm Apodaca.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
No. How much do I owe you?
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Well, you seem very professional...
Hi, Tita.
You know who it once belonged to?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Uhm hmm.
What?
My turn.
Where's Catherine?!
What would I do with it? Run amok?
Tomorrow, then.
Thank you.
At being a fake.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
That's what you said?
I'll be back later...
Catherine...
Thanks, Carl...
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
It's a Borzoi.
It is true.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Jesus, what a rude person...
Hold onto this.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
There's some good things on it, though.
Well, she was.
Yes.
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
Oh, for pity's sake...
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Just get the fuck outta here.
Is it true?
Wussup.
Nothin'.
I can't!
Eddie from Baruch, the one who was sittin' wit' dat little girl;
Pitt.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
Wha'?
Your friend must be misinformed.
Jus' from around the way.
Unbelievable.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I have no idea.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
That's Babar.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Your aunt?
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
Just relax.
Like tonight.
Affirmative.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
You don't have a piece of the action?
Yes, right away.
Thank you.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Well, I'm fully covered.
Hi Gummy. How\92s the eye?
I know.
They bust you every week.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
Yeah. Maybe.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
Who?
I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Deal.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
You've met her?
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
No, thank you.
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I ordered lunch.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Here, take mine.
God...
It's amazing.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Depends on the question.
Why did you do it?
Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I'll take you to a game.
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
Act natural.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
I'm calling the police. Right now.
Don't tell me I can't --
You shouldn't be here.
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
In her cabana, sir.
What?
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Who are you?
Moved out.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
...never reads the paper...
I don't know.  Look!
Why not? Oh shit... really?
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
You were going to can me, right?
John!
Of course.
In a minute!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
I'll do my best.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Thanks, I needed that.
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
I never thought I'd be jealous of your handicap... Sorry to hear about Bobby Vomit.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Go on, 'they're stahting.'
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
You're not funny.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
But the funny thing is, take a look at these Swiss bank account numbers. We got Bobby, Johnny, Colleen... and Julian Grendel.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Peachy.
Why are all these people after me?
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Let go of the belt!  What are you doing?  You got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Let me go out like a man.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Hey, the poet...
Mr. Doyle.
Doesn't register.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de s\E9renit\E9. Elle m'a demand\E9 de tes nouvelles et si nous \E9tions heureux.
Non!
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
What happens to the schedule?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
What?
What's he do?
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Give who a tail?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Pour it in your ear.
Whatta you got?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
What is that old building?
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
You know what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
Stay with me, Gib.  We're gonna do this.
Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Well, why not a little of the King?
I love you more.
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Uh, huh.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Wait...
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
What'd you just say?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
What?
What if it's not...
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
I never knew you, Dad.
Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
I don't know...  What about the other women?
I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
You really wanna know?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
I'm right here, Dad.
What...
Okay, okay...
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Sully!  Is that you?
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
Yeah.  Sure.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I try to be.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
No.  What house you work?
No.  Missing teenager.  Disappeared thirty years ago.  Found her bones last week.  Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street.  Mary Finelli.
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
I don't know...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I'll think of something.
I vote for me.
I love you, man!
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Stick around and you'll see.
Why don't you help us?
Everything's gonna be fine.
May be please have the wallet.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Stop the car!  Now!!
Great.  Just great.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
We're gonna scare him?!
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
It's just beginning.
Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
Huh?
Will you listen, dammit!
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
N...nothing.
'Night, Josh.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
I'm now begging you.
Have a good night.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Until I hear the truth.
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
Perfectly.
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
She didn't push me into coming.
I...I can't...
Really?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Hi, Sean.
We changed our minds.
Just radio for help, okay???
What do you mean, we must abandon?
It's over, finished and done with.
I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
Do not inhale.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
No, we're not.
She was very evasive.
This could be it.
This could be it.
They'll lose because they're my team.
Why do you need a radio?
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Everything.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Mystery. Deception.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
It's your best play, Nicky.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
That's always been my problem.
I'd forgotten that.
That's very lovely actually.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
Life is good.
I'm at the door.
You know the answer to that.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Oh yeah?
What am I doing?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
I want to believe.
Because faith is rewarded.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
How come?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
You're not making sense.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He goes to the theater armed.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
Are you sure?
Nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.
I thought you were a man of God.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
"Hell!"
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I thought you were against fighting.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
We must end the campaign.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
I hope not.
Even as a boy I thought so.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
That was England.
I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
Thank you. No.
He's "discovering" India.
Now is your chance to find out.
Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
I like football.
Don't worry.  You'll probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  We can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
I'll take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
Thank you, no.
You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Six one.
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
I'm sure I could have.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
Good choice.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
German, is that you?
No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
I was at home.
No.
Why would we do that?
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
What exactly is wrong?
Let's walk.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
And you got him...
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
Yeah.
I've been doing my homework.
No. It's been a long time.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
I couldn't have... much longer.
Want to cry now?
For exits off Main Street.
My mind's not on guessing games.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
I see it...
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
There wasn't any way to explain it.
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
Yeah.
Whatever happens it's over.
If they are not here, he must have sent them away.
Get your clothes on, move your butt.
Who was it?
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Yeah... I guess it does.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Might try that.
What about the vault?
Wire pull over?
What's it to you?
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Don't worry about me, I'll grab a cab... I can afford it, you know.
Just... tell us what you want.
I Just want to find a suitcase.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
I know.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
Yes. I told him.
Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
This is my brother's car.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
What?
Yes.
Jack, you're wrong.
That's nice.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Doreen.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
He was all right to me.
Yes.
It's the truth.
What?
Really?
No.
Nasty.
We're there now.
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Not entirely. No.
You've been watching the film.
Yeah.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Yeah.
Working at Woolworths.
At me friend's house.
Thanks.
What?
Nobody seems to know.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Who's Brumby?
No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
You sure?
I'm sorry.
No, you won't.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
And that'll make me feel better?
Jack Carter.
No, I didn't know that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Still got a sense of humour?
You should have told me who you were working for.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
The gun he means.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
They came in and they, you know...
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
Eh?
You get a bad month, all of a...
It's not right.
...cower in his boots...
Nurses.
He is?
What act?
What?
Yes...?
How?
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Did you talk to Graff?
What?
I...
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
What does that mean?
Absolutely.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Is that what I just said?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
Huh?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Was I?
No.
You think so?
Where did Moss...?  I...
You understand?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
No.
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
Thank you, George.
I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Who are you?
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
...after the thirtieth...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
The leads are assigned randomly...
Not lately you can't...
Twenty percent.
I saw the board.  You've got four...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
You want something off the B list?
That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
What does that fucking mean?
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Who kept the other half?
Was it?
Mmm.
Only the beginning...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
They took the phones...
Mmm.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Like you taught me...
He's right, Williamson.
What is it?
Twelve-fifteen.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Kenilworth...?
One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
Me.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
I don't know.
What do I...?
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
The check wasn't cashed?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
We're going to speak to her.
What does that mean?
I...
I don't have the power.  I said it.
The power to negotiate.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me not to talk to you.
Not to my knowledge, no...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Guess who?
Some of them...
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
I got lots of presents.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Just a few days.
That's right.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
How are the kids?
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
I didn't turn against nobody; he turned against me.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
It was hard to have him killed.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
What's that?
...Who?
I've always taken care of you.
You're nothing to me now, Fredo; not a brother, not a friend, I don't want to know you, or what happens to you.  I don't want to see you at the hotels, or near my home.  When you visit our Mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there.  Do you understand?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Why?
Chi?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Sure, Mikey.
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
That plane goes to Miami...
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Mike wants it.
Tom, what do I do now?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Yes, Michael.
Yes, Michael, it does.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
You would have killed his brother?
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Who's asking?
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
I do not.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
I thought we would meet alone.
Some water.
Keep them alive.
Sitting right behind you.
My lawyer went over this beforehand.
We got friends in the commission.
What about Michael Corleone?
Yes.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Weird.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn't mean to...
You liked it too.
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Of course.  I am married still.
Well...no, not really --
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
I put him to bed.  He's not there?
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
What?  Oh yes.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
What's to sketch?
But why?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
What?
All right, I guess.
Go ahead.
Did you now?
Did anyone laugh?
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
Can't today.
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
No.  I --
The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Not fear.  More like disgust.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You're the one who started it.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
David produced her last picture.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
I see.
What happened?
Not at all.
Your friend?
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You only embarrass yourself.
Elsa?
Oh dear.
Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard.
Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
Quite.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Head.  Not heart.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Point-five ...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
I knew you'd say that.
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
I hope you know what you're doing. God help you if you don't ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
What do you mean -- ?
How is he?
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
Get out of here, then. Now.
Kip.
You know my back.
Double-meaning intended --
Castlebeck.
Double-meaning intended, right?
Keys were in it ...
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
Good.
It's all microchips and shit ...
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Remember who my brother is?
Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
You, too, Ma...
No.
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
Of course ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Every day. I wonder about that every day...
You remember that, Kip?
We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
Oh, for God's sake
You've been pre-booked...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Yeah... You want a ride...
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Hello, Memphis --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Otto called -
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
Thank-you ...
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
No problem -
A distinction worth noting ...
Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
That what you want?
No way ...
No ...
Oh, yeah.
Cut 'em...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
Wrong preposition...
How is he -- ?
Yeah ... You -- ?
What's that?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
So what's in there -- ?
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Not really -
Not --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Wha?  Me?
Why would I get into that?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What are you talking about?
I can't do it anymore.
With what?
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
Fuck Jimmy and the money. Didn't I tell you I gotta get out of here first.  I gotta straighten every- thing out with Paulie or I'm dead.
Paulie was just talking about him.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
How?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
He heard.
You're some fucking jerk.
Yeah, yeah.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
No, no. It's okay.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
I got dry cleaning.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Please?
What? Come on!
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
We're not goin'.  I don't even like "Kelly's."
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
No one. I didn't have the number.
She went to Medical school in California.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Ah, history I think.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
Yeah, it is.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
I have about seventy-three...
History.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
That's one aspect of what we do.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Yeah, can I help you?
No students work for me.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Fuck do you want?
That's right.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
It's Saturday.
Find out what?
Uh-oh.
That would be fine.
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
What's the point?
Let's hit "Kelly's."
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
How about the ones on that shelf?
What did you think?
I did.
Nautilus?
285.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
--Well, maybe that means you.
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Time's up.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
It sure ain't good.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
What?
I kind of got that impression.
Okay, sounds good.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Okay...
Not far from here, South Boston.
You know, nothing special.
Well...
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
They don't come over here that much.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Yeah, but how do you know?
I'm not sayin' I'm not in love with you.
What am I scared of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
At least you have a mother.
Joe!
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
What's it to you?
Sure, but what is this?
But--but how we gonna eat?
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
Why ain't they more like it?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Crate fell on me.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I ain't gonna run.
Thought you was in jail.
I dunno. Payin' five now.
I aim to.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Why don't you get to it, buddy?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Naw--not much!
Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
Sure, but you'd a throwed a fit if I hadn't tol' you.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
It don't take no nerve to do somep'n when there ain't nothin' else you can do. 
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
California.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Granma's dead.
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
You promised, Tommy.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
He was a good man.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tommy.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
We gonna stay, ain't we?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Man bones?
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I won't--  --if you won't tell what *I* done!
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
What?
Computer guy.
Really?
What do you want to do?
Overflowing with love.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Okay.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Yep.
Bad television.
That'd be good.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
What?
Like love?
It's something I do...
You're a government spook?
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Come on.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
We're both professionals, Oatman.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Hey, Bob.
It was the PLO.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
And they want me to make up for it.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Never enough.
See you next week.
Tell them my house exploded.
Yeah...
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Need a lift?
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
How did you find out all that?
Huh?
I won't ask you to.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I don't care.
Whatever you want.
I don't care.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
No, you just act like you do.
Don't they believe in signs here?
Why? There's no food in the house?
I said... I started.
That's not true.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Good.
Did you speak to Farlow?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I love you.
Doing what?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Night.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Oh, I don't know...
No. He had the choice.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
Yes, it does.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
Diane!
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
She's an editor.
I don't have all day.
I don't know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
What does that mean?
No!
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
I just could never say it!
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
Fit? You want to check my teeth.  Good crowd today. I think you'll have some fun. You going to stay for dinner?
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Sometimes.
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Waste the dude.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those Gibsons, baby? Ooooh!
Super hero like even.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
Curtis.
Revenge.
Blow me.
Never heard of you. Done anything?
How did you know that?
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
Are you challenging me?
If I win, you become my slave.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Okay. I'll copy it.
Uh, hold on...
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
It's my subway defense system.
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
I think we've got something.
We caught 'em.
My name is the Plague.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
Joey, Joey...
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. Now, as I so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...God. So would your holiness care to change her password?
Excuse me?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
No, you don't understand.
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
We've been better.
Michael Myers.
I don't know!
Brady!
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
How many bodies did you find?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Outside.
If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
Got it Earl.
Like a sister?
Like a real sister?
He's coming to get me Rachel.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Oh Rachel!
Then we'll be safe?
All right. Good Good.  Logan I want you right here by the front door. This is the dead bolt key.
You knew. You just didn't care.
I don't want to look pushy.
The state police won't know how to stop him.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
They didn't know what they were fighting.
What's going on?
Calm down. Calm down. Are you all right? Are you all right?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
Huh?
We just talked.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
Okay. Bye.
Of course.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
No, he's not.
Yeah.
Promise?
He isn't a man.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I found the car! He's here!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Same time, same place.
Sure. Sure.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
I don't like that story.
Why are they under there?
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
What is it, Laurie?
I'm scared...
Was it the bogyman?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Are there any special instructions?
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
Mm-mm!
Well, let's hope so.
Well, let's do it.
A lot of works.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Right.
Yeah.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
No, he called late last night.
No, the funniest show that Mickey and I ever did was the one we won the Emmy for.
Yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  But the show was about the two Frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
When did you first notice this?
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Like what?
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
I don't know exactly.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
Oh, Elliot!
Oh.  Well, I live--
No, I don't have time.
No?
I'm...all right.
No, I don't think so.
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Poor Hannah.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
No.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Get his wine away.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
No, nothing.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
No.
No.
Yeah.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Yeah?
Hello?
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Oh...
Like what?
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
I got two minutes.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
He's fine.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Oooo.
Oh?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Uh-huh.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
So what's new?
Yeah, that's clerical.
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
You want some?
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
...I had a great time tonight, really.  It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
How are you?
I'm fine.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Hmm.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Well...  I'll tell you.  One day about a month ago...
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Hmm.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Take our literature...
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
...you don't have to think.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I have not read you your rights.
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
Let's keep it to business, shall we?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
And who is "they?"
I know her by the Back.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
Seen what, sir..?
...Let's see the pigs, please.
Somewhere in Italy.
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
The children...?
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
....what...? 
Starling...?
You seen John Brigham...?
...standard issue...
I think its meaning is clear.
Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
Said what?
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
...should love to correct your error. 
I'll have them picked up.
You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
How so?
I have had the honor. 
She my foster.
Spoken like a Protestant.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS!

You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
....because we don't have any mmm...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
...what did you want? 
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.

They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
...no...
What is your point?
...yes...?
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
Yeah, his lack of intelligence. Sorry, Wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
They wouldn't be a bit surprised..
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
You guys have been so colossal...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.

Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Goodnight.
You and Wichita go to school together, right?  Have you two ever...
That wants to be a Yes.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
We need more ritalin. Can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Yes you do.
Iunno.
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Shut the fuck--!
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
All right.
I'll think about it.
Geez, don't listen to them.
Never say never.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Heather? Wha...
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Give it up girl!
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I don't really like your friends either.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Next channel, darling.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
French.
So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Of course.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
"You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it!
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school <u>was</u> society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Shut the fuck up, all right.
May<u>be</u>.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
That's three things.
But my name's not...
We're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
I'm not hungry.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
hurries over.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
gives her a sympathetic look.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
He . . .
This . . .
That idiot boarder?
You mean travel by ourselves?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Mummy!
All right, then.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
All finished.
Bull...
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Eighty third most common.
You just made that up.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Yeah, how's that?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
How much time off?
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
In a word? Lucrative.
What?
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
Who the hell are you talking to?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I surrender...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
YOU!
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Right.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
JOEY!
That's not what I mean...
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
John, I know all about it.
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
What about a reward for coming forward?
She's talking to him now.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Okay.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
I'm looking for some perfume.
You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
No, no, no, no.
That would be stupid.
Who doesn't?
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
Just show me the way.
Bye, Neil!
Holly -- that's not so.
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Here, take this out to the table.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
What's that?
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
What?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Fuck you, Philip.
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
He wasn't there.
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
We'll talk in the morning.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Two -- three if you count the husband.
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I have a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Even cosier.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Talk to me about what?
They appear to be authentic.
I'd like you to see this.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
A few days ago.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Aye.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Aye -- yet one such as I who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  Days of Robin of the Hood and Arthur Pendragon.  They were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Leaving what?
For what?
Living.  Remember?
No.  What am I to do?
It's done.
That doesn't matter.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
I'll be fine.
Jennifer.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Then how did he know your name?
New York is dangerous place.
You're twenty minutes late.
I wanted to get to know you better.
Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
Conner?
What?  How?
I don't think it is a duplication.
And this?
I know, Paul.
This cannot be.
That's what the Kurgan said.
It will not end tonight.
Me too.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
Yes.
Why?
I think he's dead!
Yes, sir.
Get to work.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
What do you want to do?
I understand.
I'll make the call.
He knows better than that.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
Like what?
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Okay.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
Take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
I don't eat junk food.
Give me an ETA.
I think you got no choice.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You said they would be here!
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
I don't drink beer.
What I want is to help my father.
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Go, Chief.
You have her cell number?
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Order your men to stand down.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
Not until the man calls.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
In my room.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
I thought they locked you in your room.
Yes, sir.
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
You can let go.
These disks . . . where are they?
I guess we do.
Yes, Benedict, what can I do?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
What's happening?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
What did they say?
And what will they do with these satellites?
\93Well rewarded\94 Those were his words.
Listen, you need me.
Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
For supplies, you drive.
I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
I couldn't help.
No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
I sent them home. Go and call them.
Dawn. Then they go.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
What for Paul.
You cannot go alone.
In Ruhengeri?
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
Paul! Then another voice.
There is one thing I need right away.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
What's wrong?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Thank you, sir.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
Where?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
So what stopped her?
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Oh dear.
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
And I think that's case --
Yes.
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
Prove it.
Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?
Most fun I've had all day.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Better living through electricity.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
He's dead...?
It's succeeding!
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Jesus!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
I hope not.
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
-- I pose you the same question --
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
No, no, it's just --
My wife. Where were we?
I can't remember at the moment.
Sorry, Pritchett, here you go.
I am.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Good way to get your head blown off.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- confirming everything we already know --
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
The lockdown thing.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
You'll never find it, it's a maze down there.
He would have been back by now.
Oh, dear.
He must've unsealed the room!
-- ten.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
I'm sorry.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
I don't understand.
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
She talks to me.
Ok...
Where is she now?
Ok.  If you want this room, you can have it.
He's blessing the house.
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
It's dark!  I can't breathe!
Aubrey run! Aubrey stares in horror at Maura - just then the knife FADES AWAY as Maura rolls over, returned to normal -
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Were you fooling with the power?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
Should I...
Know what?
What?
I'm ok.
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Yes, I am.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
And you...are?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
The amulet...
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
Yes, they are.
We'll be there.
What?
Well what is it!
Jesus Christ ...
I know what I saw.
No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
Then tell me what to do.
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Did you know him?
I'll do it!
I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
And he still sits there?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
You're JP Monroe, right?
Unh-unh.
And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Really?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
I laughed, I cried.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece. Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian model of a never executed statue. I consider it to be the prize of tonight's auction of objets d'equestrian.  Horse things.
But I said I was sorry....
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Anna, I think you better stay....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
You're supposed to be dead!
God go with you, sister.
Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Uh....old badminton injury.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
You've got a dilemma, tiger.  I think I know what's going to help you solve it.
If you think you're getting past me...
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
With a little jazz.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Oh, no, really, I --
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
-- or lack thereof?
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Worked in a watch factory?
Phony, huh?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
I'm sure you do.
What the heck they doin'?
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I haven't had --
Wait a minute!
Oh my God, sir!
But, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Ya get the special?
He notices.
...Her mother needs an operation...
He don't look wise.
She is!
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
Where?
Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
You mean a figurehead.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Of course not!
Why did you come in here?
Help me? How?
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
Yes.
I hated myself.  I kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power; they had no strange drugs; that there is no such thing as a Zombie.
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Foolish?  Tell them how foolish it is, Paul -- tell them!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
And as usual no one believed me...
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Good night.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Hmm. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
You think I --
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
In the car.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
Elena.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Hnnn.
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Nah.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
C'mon.
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
I thought I'd start trying. If you don't mind. But I am going to Florida and I do have a new nurse.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
Let me.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
Yeah. You?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
Educated guess.
Forget how to ride a bike.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Am I right or am I right?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Great, thanks for the tip.
Thanks for the advice dad.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Tell Sandy? What?
I dunno. I --
I don't know.
Wendy!
Watching what?
Charles, what time is it?
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Are you his girlfriend?
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
One more shot?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
What's the D.A. got them on?
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
Too bad...
Don't worry about him...
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Yeah.  All over.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
Worth pursuing?
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
Has her books in it.
I'm going to the hospital to talk to him now.  You get the search party together.  No fewer than thirty people.  I'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes.  Don't waste any time.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
I'm always all business.
What is it?
What kind of stuff?
The other guy?
After that she left the party to go to him.
Ran like hell to go to him...
You don't know.
Good to see you, too, Randy.
You don't know.
What was?
The phone call.  The knapsack.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Did you have sex with her?
No back-up.
Drop the gun, Walter.
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
That's what the one who made me said.
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
You let them do it.
No.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
What night? What do you mean?
Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
No. Laudanum.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Nonsense all right. But something tell me it's going to be the strangest nonsense we've ever seen.
And no one knows but us...
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
How do you mean, start?
I can't do it.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Yes...
Sure...
Fascination...
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
I can't.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
That's all past, Lestat.
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
You're not lying to me, are you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
No...
My daughter...
Yes!
Checking in...Karla Wilson.
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
What about a radio?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
Who? Who is here?
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Don't even think about it.
Some.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Then, we fight --
What do we do?
No, you're not.
Ray, we're just friend.
Why are you being like this?
It's okay.
What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.
Who?
I told you.
I don't know.
To get out of Southport?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
It's in my room!
Did you get help?
He's in it with Willis?
Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Hello?
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I said we start having fun. And that means now.
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
No. I shot him.
They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
What is up with that weirdo?
You collect these to sell, abroad?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
In case you do so, would you --
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
This was once a cemetery.
No.  She shall not be left here.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
Sleep well.
I think not.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then \97- I'll not die \97\97 I'll watch -\97 they shall not hurt you.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
That should decide it or you --
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect \97\97young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
I don't understand you.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Thea?
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
How did she die?
Listen to what I say --
The General threatened me.
I can't.
He hates all my race.
It is for that he hates me.
So I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
Who?
I hate to do this, fella.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
George Bailey.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Of course it's the place.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
When'd you see him last?
That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. And if you ask me, that's where you belong.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Zuzu \96\96 Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Oh \96\96 Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Ummmm . . .
Aw, get going!
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Very funny. Very funny.
What's that?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
I'm not going to go, George. I changed my mind.
It's important.
George . . .
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Hello?
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Have you notified the police?
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
You may kiss my hand.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
Thank you.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Mary . . .
Thanks for dropping around.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
Just a teensie one \96\96 ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
George, darling! Where have you been?
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
What?
With butter, if they got any....
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Is she responsible for the punch?
Too hot in the lighthouse?
We're hung up on something.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
We'll take your supercargo.
Sean!  Catch it!
The rope!  The rope!
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Not the drugstore!
Right.
Please.  It's my job.
Got it.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Yeah?
I kind of had plans....
Hey, come on....
Is that what it is?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Why?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Fooling around?
Home it is.
What're you guys doing today?
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Careful.  What's wrong?
Nothing, huh?
Oh.  Want to talk about it?
Do you?
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
Maybe they are!
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
That's what he said.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
Great.
Waiting for Andy.
Maybe.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Nope.
Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
And second?
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Until we find something.
Power line.
Is there something I don't know about?
I'll be right there.  Wait up.
I love it.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
When are we going out?  You and me?
Coming about, then.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
What the hell is he doing?
Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
You buying?
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Want another one?
Hope I make it through both.
I guess.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Take a deep breath and hold it.
Just put your mask on.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
That we swim.
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
You don't.
What's up?
Well, that's why you got it.
Hydrophobia...
I can't take water, Kathryn.
It's a shark's tooth!
It was removed from Charlie Overman's body.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Michael, you're not going down there.
Only to myself.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
No!
Well, then I'm going to film it.
So do I, love.
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Afraid I can't do that.
Thanks for helping.
Ten minutes ago.
Don't blame yourself.
Sure.
He's missing.
Sure.  No problem.
Someone's looking for you.
Yeah, from Boston.
And alone.
SEAN!
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
I am serious.
Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
Now what?
Precisely.
Buzz off.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
It's not closing, Mike.
Got a job for me?
... I'll go to McDonalds.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Don't hurry back.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Tell Dad we're getting married in Las Vegas.  In one of those chapels.  He can meet us there.
We're in love.
Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
He told me you both did....
Nowhere....
We need milk....
No....
What's wrong?  What happened?
It went away....
I don't know....
It's beginning....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
He knows what he has to do....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
You can stay in my room.
Mommy lets me....
I didn't.
Thanks for the consultation....
You guys must be starving....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Okay.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
There's nothing to worry about....
Why'd you come out here?
I'm the captain of this majestic ship.  It goes where I take it....
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Doesn't matter....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
No one does till they learn....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
It's wonderful....
Nothing....
No, you're not....
Good.  I have two left....
I have my own little island.
You're always taking time off....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
My vision is perfect....
I do....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
Just like that?
You got a better idea...?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Aye, aye, Captain....
Tell Thea I'm sorry....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Put me down....
I didn't do it on purpose....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
They put bombs on dolphins....
It's not a bad life, Jake....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
What?
Down here....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We got it together, Jake....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
It'll work....
If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
In a few minutes....
Here it comes....
I'm training to....
What?
Oh no--
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
Uh huh .. He's well rehearsed ..
O.K.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
It's a method for quitting smoking.
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
How'd you do it, old man?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
To throw out of the window.
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
I was wrong.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
I'm asking it.
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I'm going up to the institute.
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I don't see that at all ..
No, Sir.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Three or four.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
No .. But we have a theory ..
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No.
I don't know.
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
It was probably the wind.
Well, I'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
How d'you know what I'm like?
I know.
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Even better.
I'm sure he is. But gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
I see what you're saying.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Oh, tell the story.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
My son... my mind...
You think so?
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Hello?
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
We will be fine!
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Good evening.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Good night.
Oh hell yes.
Easy, easy --
Why do you love me?
Tell me -- let me help --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
He's in the living room asleep.
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Good.
-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
Said who?  Sugar?
We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
Rod, get on the camel.
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
How do I know?
No.
No.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Go.  Flee.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
Not a chance.
Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
You'll lose.
No.
Funny.
A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
Right up ahead, buddy --
This is how you play God.
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Just drop it Paul!
No, it's...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
That one time was just the bumper.
Who's that?
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Just hold on.
He loves you too.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
They're here.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
NO!
I try not to.
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Are you sure?
Then we go home?
Something must've scared them.
You should.
No. I couldn't see.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
It certainly does.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
No.  I feel something.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
Not without a shot of the nest.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
That was about a year ago.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Okay.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
You've broken its leg!
Why?
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Oh, God.
Our chance to do what?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
It has a broken leg!
What do you think they want?!
What's that?
Why did you come here?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case, it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact, human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Funded by whom?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
I believe in him.
Oh, no!
JUMP!
So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
What now?
Where did the vehicles stop?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Uh - - about two million.
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
We're - - still perfecting a viewing system.  The raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
What kind of park is it?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
It's my favorite.
You can't hold it by yourself!
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The other car!
I don't know.
Stick to my heels.
Why not?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Must go faster, go, go.  Open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! Here it comes!  Stand on it!  Fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah - - great.
Really?
Tim, are you okay?
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
But - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
Nope.
Not without massive sequence gaps!
Kids get scared.
I didn't say I was scared.
We gotta do something.
There's gotta be something - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Sure.
Excellent.
They don't bother me.
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake, I think we should follow the shoreline to --
I really think we should go back...
Fuck you.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on, but they're panicking back there.
Compared to this guy... amateur.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Video store?
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns, Comedies, Film Noire, Science Fiction...
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Insomnolesence...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
There's a pizza place over on Market.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Yeah, what is it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Small.
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.
I don't know what you could have read.
In a manner of speaking.
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Yes.
I gave it to him yesterday.
I'll commit that to memory.
Yes.
You're just doing your job.
You're detestable.
Sit down, Kafka.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Why were you given notice?
You don't believe that.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
-- Just doing our job.
Then why haven't I been --
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
-- How would <u>you</u> like to be in a horrible situation like that?
Amerika for us!
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Now Ann ...
Father ... Father!
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
An ape ... some kind of ape.
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
What about him? Yes.
She was with you after she left Frank.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Sorry. 
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
I guess he figured it was better.
Like for you to look for the man.
Yes -- all right --
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Mm.
Most of them.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
No.
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
We did this before.
Yup.
I was wondering what that was.
Drop it.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
I am.
I believed her, Pete.
Yeah.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
It's in the report.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Did she talk about him to you?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Yes?
He's in his room, playing.
The prospect of losing my child.
What about your mommy?
Greatest...
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
That's okay.
I'm allergic to onions.
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
You're no bargain either, pal.
You mean for good?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Dad?
Sure.
You like it?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
Boy, I bet you if mommy ever saw this she'd remarried you.
Yeah, there was apple juice.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
No, son, I didn't get fired.  I'll tell you what we'll do, okay?  How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V. and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow. Just you and me...How 'bout that?
Why does he decide?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Where will my toys be?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
I do not, your honor, however--
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?
No questions.
Objection!
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Eight, almost nine years.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
Do you have a lover now?
I...I don't know...
I don't know...
Joanna, I don't give a--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Joanna, what the hell is--
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
No more waiting in Coffee Shops ...I promise.
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Me?  I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Murray.
Fine.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Look, Ted, all I--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
No.
I understand.
I'm sure.
Three.  And add some basil.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Me?!  You want me to take care of Billy?!
A moment.
I know.
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
General Chiang.
Soon.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
Then, we shall meet.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Far, far away.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Answer. 
I am him.
Roughly five thousand men.
You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
I had relinquished doubt.
You will always!
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
Is that true or pretend?
Ahh.
Ahh.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Eliminate you.
We cannot.
How could I ever leave?
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
I see that.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
Go ahead.
It happens when I land.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
I coulda shot you, you--
They don't really attack underwater and--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
Yup.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
Raincheck.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
They could try to tranq him on land.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Ssssh!
You're mushing it a little around the--
<u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
Well...
He heeds a tourniquet.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Yeah.
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
Good thinking.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Obviously I was wrong!
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
You threw it at me!!
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
You like Jack?
You think Jack's handsome?
What?
She's worried about the cow now.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Absolutely.
The somebody else part?
A jerk.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
Kelly--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Thanks, Ardelia.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
I understand.
Yes sir. I can find it by myself.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
May I see your credentials?
I'm - still in training at the Academy.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed your patient?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Mmm. And what else...?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Later, listen, I'll -
I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
We leave in the morning?!
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
"Some"?
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
We were headed...
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
That is sedition! Treason!
Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
We don't.
Your enemy...
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
What else?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
That's all, sir.
By your leave, sir.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Atten-hut!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Gifts?
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
What has?
Crunch...Implosion.
No.
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
Can't we fix it?
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Roger.
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
What music?  There ain't no music.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
Under there?
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
Sixpack...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Probably no longer than four weeks.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
It looks like \EDt, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
Jesus Christ!
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
All right, Dad.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
Just give me the keys.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
He means they're thieving dogs.
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
Right as rain.
I'11 meet you in the car.
I'll only be a minute.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
For half a million?
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
Of course you are. All right, Ed.
Seven hundred each.
I'll only be a minute.
So?
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
That's going on optimism.
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
Six.
How the fuck should I know?
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
Just shut up.
So?
Oh, come on, Amado--
I can't take any more school.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Yes, sir--
I am, sir.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I do, sir.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Sergeant?
You're testing me?
Yes, Sergeant.
Yeah.
He swore by it.  What?
So is Buddy on your short list?
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Do I seem jumpy?
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
So they stayed in Florida?
They fought against the Indians?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
My father.
You own this place?
It's a lead mine.
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
You could take it--
That ring--
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We have a daughter.
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
'57, 1 believe--
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Seems like we have another one every week.
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Buddy Deeds--
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Well, you hire illegals--
A little older than Paloma is now.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
You ever play one of these?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
Not if I can help it.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Okay? He's not here?
Yeah?
It's Saturday.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Most people did, yeah.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Yeah.
More, I hope.
Yeah.
I been working on a few things.
Gotta be in person.
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Another woman?
Uh-huh.
I know that.
Been away. Up to Houston.
Nix?
How?
You heard right.
Why would I do that?
I could scoop them out.
What is he?
He's with us... He's with us...
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Yes.
Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
You don't?
Does that mean...?
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Harry.
When do you want me to start?
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
Why?  Because he had you?
You didn't marry him for love.
No.
Nothing?
Quaid and Jennifer--
Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
I'm here, Harry.
I think so.
Good.  There.  Yes?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
--vanished.
So could you walk on water?
I heard he was the best.
I need to speak to you, Mr. D'Amour.  About last night.
Maybe I just bought it.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
What about?
A Mister Quaid?
Not much.
You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
He deserved it.
It's me betrayed him.
Is that all?
In my time, and nobody else's.
You didn't try hard enough.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
I got to go.  I'm late.
What about Philip Swann?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
Fuck you.
Yes.
Yes.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I'm here for the week.
I know, it's stupid.
I know. I don't either.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
No, you smiled.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
Ok, whatever you want.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
That's ok.
We established that we have no communication.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
Where'd you grow up?
Yeah, look at that thing.
A coke.
That's what you said the other night.
Ok, well... I love you.
Is this a bad time?
It's just carpet.
Is there anything I can do?
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Do you want I send it to your room?
Excuse me?
One moment, please.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
What?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
I gotta go to work.
I don't know.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Bad?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Must be a spare set.
I'm gonna go make a stink.  Sit tight. I'll make sure you get a change of clothes.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
I think I should join you.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
I hope so.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Something he said, just before...
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Yes.  We won, that's right.
What's his name?
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Please, the children.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
What's the...OH SHIT!
When's your birthday?
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
We're going to do this.
Maybe that's my problem.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Whish the circumstances were different.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
Thanks.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
Oh, sorry.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
It's okay.
Four days.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Yeah, right.
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
How's that been?
Lucky.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't care.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
Oh.
For how long?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
I don't.
I don't.
Yeah.
You either.
He ain't Spalding.
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Figures.
None of your business.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What?
You do see me standing here, right?
I said fine.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
You're not stupid.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Why not?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
What's up?
Nobody.
Not really.
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
The "man" again.
I never asked you to choose.
I don't think so.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
Uh huh.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Oh yeah?
Thanks.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
Something was just missing.
you woke me up to tell me that?
What?
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
Business folks.
At one in the morning?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Okay.
Sorry.  You okay?
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
You know, people.
What mess?
What?
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You want me to fuck off?
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Did you hear what I said?
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Who was it?
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
What's that stand for?
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Well I don't go out very much.
Can I tell you something?
I've got troubles.
Cynthia?
How much time do we have?
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
We're not gonna do that now.  We're not gonna do that now and that's over.
-- no.
Sorry, little man.
Why the hell aren't you in school?
I ain't fuckin with you --
You're a friend of the family I presume?
-- Samuel Johnson.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Stay that way.
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
Yes.
Don't do this, Don.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
You do?
Where is he?
She loves you.
Yeah.
I've seen it before.
Who?
Is Jack your son?
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
Hi.  Is Frank there?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
Alright.  Thank you.
You got us a room so quick?
Let's talk about --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
So boring, so useless --
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
-- fuck you.
My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
"Go Get 'Em, Honey."
He passed away.
people die.
I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
Did your wife find out?
All your other fluzzies?
I won't.
I got in trouble at school.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
As fast as I can.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Paula.  Ellen.
No one else that I know?
How long with Ellen?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Do you have any children with anyone?
It's alright.
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
No.
Like what?
What's MOW?
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
Shut the fuck up.
Hang up the phone.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
Yeah.
Water.
I need this one.
You're late, not me.
-- I didn't see you from the window.
See you.
I'm fine. nothing.
Stand up.
I have money to give you.
I can take you to get money.  I don't need it...I don't <u>need</u> it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
To the Bastille.  And death.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
Why didn't you say so?
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
He lures us to capture.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Athos, my friend!
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
How did you know -- ?
I decided it this morning.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
... You knew you had a double?
My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
Forgive?!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
No, Keeper.
What was the end page?
... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
Oh Louis, Louis...
Yeah?
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
So what?
Alright, stay on the phone.
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Right behind you.
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
He said he was following up some lead.
Yeah?
Seattle.
You're the mysterious type, right?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Yeah.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
1490...Breckinridge...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
I knew I could count on you.
What else is new?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
How are Molly and the boy?
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Not the Bible?
I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
No.
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
What do you want to do?
What's one way?
To recover the mind set.
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
I'll pick you up in...
When I'm done.
You wanna watch this or what?!
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
In eight days.
You'll come by?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Yes.
I'm very scared.
Yes.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
Dr. Chilton.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
Cut the general crap.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay...  He's after you now, isn't he?
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
You haven't smoked in two years.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Will?  You could come up here.
You got a deal...
Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
Go on to the house...
No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
That's interesting.
Yes. I'd considered it.
What do you want?
Pretty well.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Those are my terms.
He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
What's up?
The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
I'm here, ain't I?
No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
It's me.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
It is apparently not working.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
I used to think you were original.
Why isn't he MOVING??
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.
What?
Oh, God.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
You killed them.
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
Have to.  The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.  You get used to it, though.  Your brain does the translating.  I don't even see the code.  All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  You want a drink?
How?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
But what if...?
You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
The Matrix?
Far from it.
You've never used them before.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
Show me.
Your mind makes it real.
What -- what lesson?
I think I do.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
... shit.
What?
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
Is Morpheus still alive, Tank?
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I'm going in after him.
I'm coming with you.
No?  Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
Do what?
No.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
Duck!
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
I don't know.  I lost him.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
Why?
Can't we come with you?
Be careful.
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
Kennedy.
Not quite...but keep trying.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Didn't show up.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
Good idea.
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
How much was the original loan again?
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
I know.
Oh...around...why?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
All right.
What was it?
Wha?
Charlie...?
Did you?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Sure...He lives there?
You're intolerable today.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
 Shut up.
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
You what?
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
We've got some things to discuss.
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
But what?
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
I thought you were buying my company.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Thank you.
Cold.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
Do you think I need a haircut?
What?!
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
As much as Joe's?
Please, Drew.
I don't care.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
I don't think so.  Do you?
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Thanks, Quince.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
Yes.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Hey, this is fun.
You're welcome.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
You love Allison, don't you?
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
I'm lost.
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Why don't you get off his case?
I said get out.
Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
And is your heart beating strangely?
How beautiful.
It gets worse.
-- Yes?
'Threw' you?  Where?
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
What do you mean?
No.
I don't understand.
Of course.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
'Fish'?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I think you heard me, Bill.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
I don't expect you to.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
Death!
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Then don't.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I believe you did.
It's enough now.
I'm here.
It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
You think Drew will go for it?
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
I am.  With you.
I know it's none of my business --
You mean like you loved Mom?
Probably.
Uh oh --
You're not listening --
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Nothing.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Raise away.
I don't understand.
That's why it's okay.
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
You and 'Honey'?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
No --
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I'm sorry... um... ?
I have no memory.
As requested.
This isn't my room?
When was I in here?
Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
A cop?
Who did this to you?
So you have information for me?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
Yeah. You?
That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Just relax.
Who did he go to meet?
I'll go see him.
He'll kill you, Lenny.
I told him about your car.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
I have this condition -
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Thank you.
Sweet.
Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
Did Teddy send you?
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
Thank you.
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Probably left it in your room.
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
Fucking hope not.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
Why are you following me?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Yes, I will.
This bad cop. He checked you into the			  * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you		    * for days, sticking envelopes under your			* door, telling you shit.						 *
What's your twenty?
Turn around.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
Okay.
And what is that?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
No.
Died in childbirth, having me...
Hola, viejo.
When?
Of course.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
I know.  And now?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Alonzo...
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
Five minutes...
Who knows...
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
No.
As in...?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
What's the point?  It's going down.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
I don't understand...
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said, he didn't give you up.
Yes.  What's up?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Meaning...?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
Don't guess. Just come for my day's pay owing and to tell you I'm heading East.
Men, they mostly faggots.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Whatsa matter now?
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
You like it? Take a look.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Don't need a comb.
What of?
They gotta be.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Get outta my way.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Ready for anything.
Instant V-goddam-D.
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Is he all right!
Getchmis...?
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
We go through the wall?
Ziat!
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Not far. Just a little way.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
Stupid.
I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
And?
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Yeah!
It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
After we're outside the kogus?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
What?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Mr. Yesil.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Weird shit...?
New York's finest.
H-how do I get...?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Oh, Jesus!!
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
I pull.
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Please.
No, there's...
No such thing, baby.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
How?!
Peter...
We can do it!
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
Oh, Jesus.
What?
Sure.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
If you wouldn't mind.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
I guess that means it's okay.
I can live with "great."
I'm getting to believe you.
The Sistine Chapel?
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
Well, I hope you like it.
I DIDN'T...
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
You did great, except there's just one little thing--I can't work with this paper. It's Corrasable Bond, it smudges. Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long-grained mimeo.
You know goddamn well what I've been doing--I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING. I need my pills.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
I can't write this anymore.
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
You really think so?
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
What thing?
It's good you found it.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
Buster.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
That'd be a first.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Now you've hurt me, Paul.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Mmmm.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
If it'll make you feel any better I won't do it again.
An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i>
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
It's that time.  Go.
More like two-two point two million.
Then we got'em!
I'm not ready!
Not for seven more minutes.
And the check's in the mall.
I am. She is.
No.  Should I?
Far right.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Five, six-hundred thousand.
And six billion in the world.
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Can you think of a better one?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Affirmative.
Oh Ethan!..
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
The question is why?  What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying?
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
Yep.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Nyah, Ambrose is heading back.  There's an enveloped inside --
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
By asking me.
You're right, of course.
S.O.P..
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
I don\EDt know.  It didn\EDt say on the tickets.
Good idea.
Krieger.
Don't move.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You don't think we're going to make it.
You didn't have to.........
We did what we had to do.
Bastard!
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Don\EDt disappoint me.
Yeah.
Who else is left?
Why was there another team?
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
About what?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
Okay, use it.  But I suggest pack up first.
Bank?
Give me a break, Pops.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Higher.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Very well.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Can you lose him?
- and picked us up in the States -
You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We don\EDt have to, Jim.  He\EDll come after us.
You\EDre wrong about one thing.  I\EDm not the only one who\EDs seen you alive.
Loud and clear.
Jack...that's spying.
I think I might just take that look.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Bed.
What's your news?
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You have too many dogs.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
Yesterday.
Why what?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Seven years ago.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
Oh no I didn't!
I'm in love with you!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
It's the best thing there is.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
Why?
No.
Is Johnny here?
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
You? No.
Bobo, take the cart away.
Yes?
I don't understand.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
We should talk alone.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
And who's gonna pay for that?
I'm thirty-seven years old.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Where you been?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
A wife knows.
Well. I don't really know where to start.
She recovered.
It was a miracle.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I don't know.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
I don't know.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Sure!
That woman was a student of yours?
Don't shit where you eat.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Why do men chase women?
I think it's because they fear death.
Yes.
No.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
My God, it's a mansion!
Is who down there?
You were a tiger last night.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
Yes!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
No one live there.
Who are they?
NI!
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
And not too expensive.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
'Tis but a scratch.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
My liege,  I am honored.
Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
I am an enchanter.
Yes, I can help you with your guest.
It is the rabbit.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is your name?
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
Yes he is.
Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
When's your next round?
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
But, Mother ...
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him.
The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
No, It's nothing!
We'll cover your escape!
He's come to rescue me, father.
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
A path!  A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Did I tell you?  Did you listen to me?  Oh no, no, you knew better didn't you?  No, it's just an ordinary rabbit isn't it.  The names you called me.  Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
How about yourself?
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
Oh, I'm much more than that.
You watch your tongue.
Aye.
It's a diary.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Of course.
She's busy.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
Out of my way!
We --
Who'll bring it to me?
That's not good enough.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
What I do, I do for my Queen.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
The greasy pole.
She's well, too.
Aye, ma'am.
What?
Are they worth reading?
That doesn't make him an expert.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes, ma'am.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
Not too protracted, I hope.
Of course.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Just them?
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
It's twelve-thirty!
Alex, I think you're freaking out. Greg's gone, I'll give you that.  And maybe he's in trouble.  But it's not ARCADE that's doing it...
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
No way.
What?
Nick, what is it.
It's already out.
I can't believe you made it!
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
One.  In case...
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
Yes...
In this world, wrong is right!
Oh God...oh god...
You have no time.
Sign me up.
What did you say?
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Sure.
How's that?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
One.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Well, I ...
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
I told ya.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Right. See ya.
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
Diane?
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
But, this could be serious.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
I don't know who I am.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
I'm all right.
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
I just wanted to come here.
Go ahead.
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
No time. Get him up.
I'm listening.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
What do you mean ?
I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
Fine...
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
Yes.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
I don't help criminals.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
What ? Are you my mother ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
I just want to double check the facts.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Son, let's watch the tape.
What do you mean sir ?
Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
Sir ?
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
What did you hear ?
What ?????
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
<<belch>>
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Zach from work ?
We made it !
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Oh, just put it over there.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Don't mention it.
What about giving the other guy a break.
What do you remember about her.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Her favorite poet.
Of course.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
She just had a baby that's all.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
Does she?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
But I wanna write about her.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
I never met my mother.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Give it back Nicholas!
You're over reacting!
MOM!
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
WHAT??
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
Change my name.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
And I thought I was weird.
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Give it to me!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
Leave me alone!!
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Like what?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Committed.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
You want me to come with?
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Bye Niece, Vada.
Nothing, nothing at all.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Yes, I do.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
But Dad'll never go for it.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Good for you baby.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
Yes.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
What Hurts Vada?
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
In ages, I know, me neither.
Yes.
It's only eight o'clock.
Goodnight.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'll second that.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Pointing upwards Look...
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Dad?
Then who's it for?
Any more soda left?
What?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
Hi.
Yes.
Get away, get away!!
What??
No, no.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Oh, Vada...
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Probably.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
No, I'm divorced.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Goodnight.
I'm allergic to it.
I can't, I have to go home.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I'm trying.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
No.
What?
It's my mother.
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
I stopped that!
What?
You're right, let's knock it down.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
He likes her better than me.
It is not.
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, let's spit on it.
I should look different.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Part of being a New Yorker.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
The wandering sportswriter.
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
And you believe that.
Impressive.
The man you love.
Someday she'll thank you.
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
I wish.
I can't even say it.
It's too late to start over.
Good girl.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Well, we're...
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I was gonna predict that.
Hello.
... that this is all my fault?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
That's entirely understandable.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
It doesn't say th...
Well, somet...
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Till the gas ran out.
What, leaving school...
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Like I said, dazzling.
You keep saying that.
You've been the man in mine.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  She couldn't have lived with it.  I know that now.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
DON'T SPEAK!
That's little egotistical.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
To him.
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
What do you have to buy?
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
What's wrong honey.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
What?
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Bill, he's a crazy man.
To the bathroom.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Your brother?
Hi, Sherry.
I'm not really a musician.
A little. What do you need?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Yes, it is --
About three years.
No, I don't.
Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
Hi.
Wow!
I have to go.
I'm not sure.
Oh.
That's unkind.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Out.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
What?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
I'll be dammed.
You serious?
Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
Sure thing.
Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
Yes, they were.
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
You been followin' the news coverage?
Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
Lobotomy Bay?
By all means.
Ain't love grand.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yes, sir.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
How 'bout Manson?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Let's do it.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Sure.
You made every day like kindergarten.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Just for fun, I guess.
Where do the air ducts lead?
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
Slate it.
They're mesmerising.
Why?
But you'll never be whole again.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
No thanks.
You think so, Frankie?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
All right, you get out of here, man!
Okay.
Well, what d'you know?!
What d'you think?
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
Where's Wilma?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I been sendin' her money.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Where was your father born?
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
No thanks.
What is it?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
You got a problem all right.
Don't Duff--
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
How about it?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Yeah?
I don't want to hurt you.
You will.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Yeah!
Watch out!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Okay.
Plannin' on getting married?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Better get him to a hospital.
No, thanks.
Sorry.
She don't look no worse to me.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Okay.
How are you?
Thank you.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
How you doin'?  Hi there!
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
That'll make the folks very happy.
Hi.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
What's the matter now?
Right here.
Omar, listen to me--
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
The Elders, mon...
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
What's he doing to my gear?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
Can you read my mind?
I don't have a girl.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
It's coming.
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
No!... No...
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
I think you're full of shit.
Why should I want to meet him.
What's my end?
Couple of months.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
A regular Fagan.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Put the gun down, Case.
I'll be okay.
Something exotic I hope.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
What?
Shut up.
Well, do you?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Exactly.
YOU KNIT?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Roger in Op/Ed.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.

It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
Just get in the van, Josie.
Hidden camera.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Umm- I don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
Five-- Six--
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Oh. Right.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Are you in special ed?
Dude, you rock!
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
See!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Oh I don't think so.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
You remember that story?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Yeah, I have.
Why?
Nah uh.
You so do not deserve to be prom queen.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Well, a ball player.
Barrel.
And heavy...
No!
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
It's getting there.
And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Yeah, why?
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
I'm sorry...
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
I don't know.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Oh, Jesse...
I'm not hungry.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
Huh?
No.  I'm okay.
Sure...go ahead.
Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
Hi Mom.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I thought I'd wait for you.
Wait and see.
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
Deal.  Thanks.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Sure.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
How do we find him, Kristen?
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Can't be good news coming from you.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Nancy...
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
What's that supposed to mean?
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
Never been here before?
Sounds like a rough time.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
So do I.
Try me.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
Neil, please --
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Yeah?  What did we ever do?
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Really?
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
No.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
And what happens next in the dream?
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
I thought you were leaving.
Let's go in.
You abide by rules like that?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
She left me.
No, you were brilliant
I don't know, I'm afraid.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Well done you.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Stay forever.
Undressed like this, yes.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
And what would you say...
Tempting but... no, thank you.
Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
... get fired.
Right. 
In a depressingly asexual way.
Tony -- what do you think?
Yes -- sort of...
What?
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Still, not sparkling.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
What's your name?
Any bit in particular?
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Great.  Excellent.  Thanks.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
No, 'fraid not.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
I-I-I...
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
Mister Washington.
Will you come with me, please.
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
Thank you, ma'am.
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Why, thank you, ma'am...  Whew. Man, I tell you, that place up there is somethin' else!  Well, ya boys been practicin' up for the big game?  I figured as much...
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
O-o-o-oh...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
C-C-Come here and l-look at th this!
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
M-M-M-Mack?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
No.
Are they all crazies?
What for?
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
Huh?
A pecking party?
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Just warmin' up.
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
Whadaya bet, Cheswick?
Hit me.
Wait a minute, Martini, I can't hear a thing.  What?
Me, too! Me, too!
Yeah, it's cold!
What is it?
Hold it!
I see...
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
You're on!
You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
Shhh!  This way!
Sure...
'Kay...
Come an' see.
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
To help you relax... please...
You an' me, Chief.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Hi.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
Oh...
Thank you, ma'am,
Why, sure, ma'am...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Is he one of the loonies?
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
Oh, yeah...
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
You're sure...
Exactly.
Oh no.  Do you?
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
But, Faith--
Thanks.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I'm in love with you.
Yes.
Does he love you?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
So it wasn't real.
Who says I don't love him?...
Because.  I know where he is.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
I don't know if that's such a--
Yeah.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
You aren't?
Well.  Congratulations.
GET OUT!!
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I can't believe you did that!
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
There is no us.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Oh, hello.
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
He's a podiatrist or something.
It's a coincidence.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Only what?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Oh my God.  Where?
What?
Like a detective.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
What if he doesn't like me?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
When you could've found one in America.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
That's exactly what you are.
No, why?
Right.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
She didn't give me a chance.
She's not here.
Ten billion to one.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local\97 that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady\97 well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out\97 we take our cut.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
I don't know\97 I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Terry... Terry... .
Give it to me\97 my Pop's job\97
You training to be a nun or something?
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were\97
I only live up there and across the roof.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested \97in pigeons.
Oh she's a beauty.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
How about another one?
What a fruitcake you are!
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Listen\97 get this straight\97 don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
What for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
I\97 I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Who says?
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Well, it's over.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
He wanted to see me again.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Mind your own business, Father.
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Baseball bats\97 that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
What?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him\97 boy, I was ready that night.
Raise a hand to me and... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Looking for me?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Easy. Easy, boy.
First things first.
Hey look-
I'll bring him up to your loft.
So-so, Johnny.
Thirty-six\97 sev\97 aah I lost the count.
By way of Chicago?
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Where?
Nothing is worth your life.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
What can we do against them?
Maybe so.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
The Princess of Darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain.  Yet I am inclined for one as lovely as you, to be more lenient. I have but to touch you with my finger, and it would mean the end of you, all over, quickly and painlessly...
Ahh, she will be yours.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I will decide the conclusion.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
I'm so frightened.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
No, thanks.
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Till they got busted.
Who are you?
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
You're right.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
You know how I felt about her.
I don't know.
They sure do.
In the trunk, yeah?
You have to know what you're talking about.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
They're in 7D.
Wait.  You not Adele?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
No, I didn't know that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
We're leaving.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
In my bag, in the car.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Peter Finch.
Bleeding on a country road.
Nothing.
Really.
Shit...
Yes.
How do we do that?
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
I can go to the bar.
I don't have a problem with it.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Studs.  Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc.  What's going on?
I see better with them on.
In the trunk?
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
I'm not leaving Midge.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Like what?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
You're not?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
Uh-huh.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
You not with probation, one of those?
The State Theater?
Which one is that?  The ATF guy?
No?
Off a tip?
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Ten gees.
He was that good?
Hale-what?
You guys are new?
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Home of the brave!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Yeah.
I was grieving too.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Come on!
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Hang on.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Thank you, Sir.
Boxin'.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
If we achieve surprise, they will offer little resistance.
Brilliant, Admiral.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
All of 'em.
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Stag movies. Smokers.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
That loud\97mouthed little bitch~
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm not going.
They'll learn to live with it.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
I just can't trust you anymore.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
What?
I'm trying.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
What about Janet?
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
Take a long walk on a short pier.
What, why?
I wish she hadn't.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
What're you doing here anyway?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Is that one of your poems?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Can we split now?
What?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Open it.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh. I forgot.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Give me some credit, will you?
Come on. You can't be serious.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I couldn't help it \97\97 I loved him.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Wait! I'll go with you!
I... um...
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
I'll be fine, Dad.
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
There's a better place...
What if it's not bullshit? If I bury Zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Bob...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
I am relaxed.
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Close the law book.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Maybe you should think about it.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
A carrot?!
Don't do this, Andy.
About my blood work?
Sounds delightful.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Funny.
Continue.
Continue.
Your... lover?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Beckett? I'm sorry about... what's happened to you. It's a fucking kick in the head.
What?
Thank you.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
We're friends of Beckett's.
Not bad.
Do you... pray?
Want to hear my favorite aria?
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Yes. On my torso.
Yes.
What?
It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome.  Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on?
You bet. We'll see you later.
No.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Really?
Thank you.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Yes.
What did you say?
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Get real.
That's correct.
In a word, yes.
How many do you know?
Fine, Joe.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
You had one guy "like that?"
Andy, you don't want this.
Jesus.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Show me your eyes.
Entered our minds.
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
Get out of our way.
So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
How many?
Let's wait on the power cells.
That's what I said.
I never said I was.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
What the hell's it matter?
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
For now.
Riddick?
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Not if I'm the one.
Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Right now, if you like.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
It's probably wrong --
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
What signal?
Climb off me, will you!
Don't bother
Okay.
Try telling them our names.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then you admit --
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
A hearing.
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Maybe not.
Where?
I thought it was O'Neill's turn tonight.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Fuck you bitch.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
What?
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
Okay, here it is - one, we got gooks in the fuckin' perimeter.
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Yeah.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
Dawn...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
Yeah, I dropped out of college and told 'em I wanted infantry, combat, and Nam...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Sounds like it.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I'm sure you have.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
How do you do?
How careful should I be?
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Immigration Officer?
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
I don't.
Couldn't be.
All right--following me.
Yes.  I've never been very far from it, for a long time.  Will you do something for me?
Do you have to leave the note?
You leave it.
Frozen.
Including Killaine.
If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
You-killed-him?
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
You were there when I last saw him.
What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
All right. Get him.
Who's Goble?
You asked for it.
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
I've got good ears.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I wouldn't know.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
That COULD BE TOLD.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
Lay off, can't you?
How would you know, Brandon?
Nothing to discuss. Tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. Be grateful for small mercies.
He saw my face too.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
Open it and count it.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
So?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Warm water, no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
You didn't play it for laughs last night.
Not if it clears the air.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
That leaves two strangers.
I'll take your word.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
I do.
Nor I. This is why I gave it to you.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
You already have the checks, darling.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
I have no intension of being nasty, Mr. Mitchell.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Yes.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Yes.
I'm not sure I can face it.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Of course.
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
A glamorous young lady way above his station...
...break away completely from--
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
And you're at this third stage
How nice.
Both dead.
I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
Let me see.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Oh yes.
Mmm...
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Why not sit down and wait?
Have you come to talk about me?
Next time tell her I've gone away.
That's good.
She said that?
I won't.  Goodnight.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
De nada.
Where?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
You first!
I say when it's over!
SHIT!!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
There's nobody else here...
Yes, sir.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Thanks, buddy.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Nothing.
Figured you did.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Something... in the trees...
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Right behind you.
Anytime.
... Right, I got a score to settle for the Bro...
I saw it.
He knows our defenses.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
It pays.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
What?
Diet coke.
Do you plan everything?
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Good.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
You won't.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
I more than liked it.
Did you?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
You just did.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
It was good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Vivian...
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Thank you.
Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
But, Edward...
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
I'm up.
Let him answer.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
He's not gonna want us.
Was that you?
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Will I like it?
I'm just looking, thanks.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
Do you remember me?
I was in here yesterday.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
I think it's great.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
Then why bother curing me?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
You're a silly girl.
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
And what am I?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
As you wish.
Well ... you were dead.
No. No. We have already succeeded.
It never happened.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I'm waiting!
-- where?
The body?
I have a little.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
Sire.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
No.  To the pain.
Not yet.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
Stop saying that!
-- offer me money --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
What's that?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You are ready, then?
That would be inconceivable.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Inconceivable!
Hmm.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
What?
That's genius.  That's genius. Roger, I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER.
What are you saying?
"Honeymoon,
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Mr. Bialystock ...
What you were saying.  Keep talking.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
I already have.  Come on.
Coney Island??
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
To failure!
With whom?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Hey, Blum, have a cigar.
No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
You can count on me-o, you dirty young man.
Here I come, ready or not.
And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Where are you going vit the light?
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Send for Goebbels.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Back where?
How did she pay you?
Anyone at home?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Who are you, friend?
Money.
Sam, if she's here...
Five hundred.
All right.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
I don't need pills... just sleep.
I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, where she works, the Music Makers Music Store, you know? And she doesn't know where Mary is any more than we do.
A lot?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Just what he told your detective.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
What do you know about it?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
No.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Maybe we can handle it together. 
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Who's he?
You're not.
Watch your tenses.
She always tries to be proper.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
I could stand something regular.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
Sam!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
I have?
Thank you. Again.
It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
Norman.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Good night.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
Yes.
Shut up!
Mother, please...
From what?
He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
You--a friend to me?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Why didn't you notify the police?
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
You found Buckley?
He isn't here.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
I don't agree with you.
You would.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
It happens that I'm the law.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Now don't that call for an extra!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
If you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
He can't hear you.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
You did.
You did miss --
I'm heading out of town.
What universe are you in, Paul?
Is Rose here?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What is it, Rose?
What'd you do, Rose?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
What are you going to do, Rose?
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Well, yeah.
I don't know.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
No.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
I'm older than hell, boy. But this Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll say that.
That's all I want to know.  Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
You're not having lunch?
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
What time is it?
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
Honey, please...
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Who?
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Well, it has buttons.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Oh, yeah?
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
Incestuous.
Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
Now you know what to watch for...
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
What... ?
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
She's fine, as if you cared.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
No you can't.
You big, fat sonofabitch, if it weren't for me, you'd still be sitting in the file room where I found you.  And you... Nena... you've still got needle scars from where I pulled you out of.  You of all people...
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Wha... ?
Bullshit.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It's go time, Billy-B.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
You're lying...
I'm waiting till the time's right.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There probably is.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Well, sir...
You're about an inch away from insubordination!
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Don't crowd him.
No you're not.
No, we are <U>not</U> going to do that.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Whatever goes bang.
Just got here.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
It's one of a kind.
They're... around.
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
You cannot escape your destiny.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
But I have no sister.
Where am I?
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Fine. Together again, huh?
Leia!
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
We shall double our efforts.
Red Leader standing by.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Oh. Well, yes.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
On my mother's grave.
I told you, my car broke down.
And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Janet.
Dammit, Janet.
We must have a blow-out.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
No, don't do that.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Makes you cry
That ain't no crime
No no no no.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
By accident?
...I suppose.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Do me another favor?
Yes.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
Yeah...
...What?
Don't say that.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
It's not your house --
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
...Still don't feel no heat.
...This man.
Of wa?
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
...Ten minutes.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
That's it, I'm broke.
You have my food in ya hand.
...Fine.
You think I don't hear things?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
No -- Just me.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Hey --
Stuff it, man!
I like yella teeth.
Maybe I like garbage.
Why?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Spider Rice.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Message -- What message?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
How do you mean?
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
...The guy's great.
Great, kid, great.
Yo, can I have my locker back?
'Bout what?
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Bullmastiff.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Let's get outta this stink.
Absolutely...
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
What?
Sure I like her.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
So where is it then?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
You're a very stubborn man, Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys, show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
So you're Cloverleaf?
Surprised?
What am I, Earl?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
That was the idea.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Get away from there.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Uh? Uh?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But new struck cuz.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Benedicite! What early tounge so sweet saludeth me?
Hie you make haste! But look thou stay not till the watch be set, for then thou canst not pass to Mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy, than thou wentst forth in lamentation. Quick hence! Be gone by break of day! Sojourn in Mantua.
Romeo, come forth.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Ay me!
If my heart's dear love--
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
NO! Mercutio!
Is she a Capulet?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
How do we know that?
You lose them!
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
You sure about this?
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
I don't have it with me...
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
Because if there's more than one party involved, if we really are working for different people, then perhaps some of us are on different sides.  Your orders might be different from mine.
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
There is one other thing...
Of course.  Don't you?
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Not for long.
My way is better.
What a surprise...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
To see a man about a thing.
That's what I thought.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
I do.
So is the woman.
A lot of people died.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
Right now?
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
Do you have a good answer?
I'll work on it...
Finish the job...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
Gone.  Destroyed.
You sure?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I'm alright.  And you?
The Russian would be easier.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Torch it?!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Why don't you get to the point.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
How much?
No.  It's not.
No.  Why?
What's that?
Hi.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Nothing.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you Sally.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
Am I speaking English here?  How-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Anything...specific?
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won\92t immediately look.
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
A surprise huh?  Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them!
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Calm down --
Right behind you.
You're never getting that much.
We're gonna talk.
Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
Absolutely positively.
Anything in it?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
No, I just assumed...
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Is this about the funny money?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
I knew you were lying.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
I am a tourist.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
This is a very dangerous man.
Don't look at my ass!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
Who?
No.  She's a school teacher.
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
What?
What is it?
She's walking back towards the door.
There's people up here!
Take it!
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
She never even looked at you.
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating I just took, as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Who's Benjamin?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
It's worth it to me.
Yes.
This money is evidence.
Some Kung-Pao?
Amen to that, brother.
Fine with me.
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Excuse me?
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Baby Duck?
Did you tell Sterling?
I'll take him.
You must come with me for questioning.
Ricky Tan?
This is still Hong Kong.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
The bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  If you want the Ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
They asked for the best street man I had.
Carter.
Tell me about it.
No.
A little.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
We are both full of shit.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
Witnesses.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
What plate?
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
I got to stop that dancing in the street \8Ctill all hours.
Going into the restaurant.
This concrete?  This is still America.
It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  Take the damn gun.
Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
Shut up!
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
What are you talking about?
I'm waitin' here for a name.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
Maintain eye contact.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
I already made an appointment for later today.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving.
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter, very professional job.
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Tootaloo.
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
You'll answer my questions?
We think so.
He is not!
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
Really.
Seven-fifty.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Agreed.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
No.  You take it.
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
Missed me bad, huh?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Good boy, Port Hole.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
He's got a houseboat.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who's married to --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Does it have wheat in it?
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
That doesn't make any sense.
And then I'll see you in New York --
No.
It was my mother's.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
I think that's what I'm saying.
What?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Is this crazy?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I know. 
I want my money.
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Come on, Jonah --
Yes.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
It's me?
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
Yeah.  What's that?
I don't get it.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Go to sleep.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
I was thirsty.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
Victoria? She's okay.
Who is Annie?
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
If I didn't go.
It was all they had.
Sure.
Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
Well...
You must be Jonah.
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
What do you mean?
Hi.
You did?
You could have called me --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
He's good at it.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
That's none of their affair.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
There's nothing stopping you.
You want 'em all arrested?
I don't make policy.
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
What do you mean -- sex equality?
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
They are singing for me.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
What's more important than sanitation?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
What makes you so sure?
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Will you be still?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
I was talking to my wife.
Not even a guess?
Did you see his hair color?
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Then leave.
Never heard of him.
You can still work.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I don't want to leave you.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
Sorry.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
When? When did you ever see me use?
I don't trust anybody.
If you say so.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
Big Bill.
What?!
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
Yeah, dickhead.
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
That is so unfair.
Now that's scary!
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking lab! Now shut up.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Thank you, sir.
You must be a hell a shot.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
Keep trying.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
That's not all.  There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell.
On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him.
I heard.
You know classical music?
Where are you from, Captain?
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Same place we are.
I changed my mind.
I've got a line on one.
Maybe.
It doesn't take this.
Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
Yeah.
And what about your own hand?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
I know.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
You have orders, too.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I don't like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
Get back to your positions!
That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
Alright, come with me.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Look at Upham, you don't hear him complaining.
We know.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
For going to school?
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
Lloyd, give it up.
Lloyd.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
I admit nothing.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Read it.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
I dream about it.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Okay.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
Okay, I give up.
I'm fine.
Bon voyage.
I like him a lot.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Swear to god.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Hi.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Look at those eyes.
Yeah?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
No.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
That's cool then.
Basic.  Hmmm.
You think so?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Come on.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
What did you say?
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Be friends?
Yeah.
It was wonderful.
No I didn't.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hello Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
So what's up?
Your car?
No way.
How you doin', brother?
You know Diane Court?
I don't know.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
Alright!
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Klaus Tauber.
It's up to you.
In Breslau.
What's going on?
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
Look -
The guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. They make my workers nervous.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
Yeah, okay.
There's nothing in the stores.
Nice things cost money.
No, look.  It's the others.  They're the ones causing these delays.
Done.  Lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Oskar -
What other point is -
And killing.
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
I think it's too late.
Stern.
They arrived, can you believe it?
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
What is it?
Where?
Can we talk?
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Did it?
What?
Did you do it?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Tons and tons.
Home--where he lives.
Why don't you ask them?
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
Finish what my son started.
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
I think it's out of your control.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Until now.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing\92s been done.
Tails.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
Meaning?
And Joel's pre-med.
Let's find out.
Over here.
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
Dewey, there's no such place.
Whatever.
You're pretty when you're angry.
Watch your back.
I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
Oh my God.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
What?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
Gotta.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
I'd really just like to be alone.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
Gee, let me think. "Do you want to..." Is that the best you can do? Some tired hand me down rehash? Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. No movie rights. Nothing. I've been through this before and much better I might add.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Shush.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Hello.
Do I?
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
Always.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
And who is that?
Oh shit it's my cell!
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Yeah.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Who's this?
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
I'm hanging up right now.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Are you sure?
Oh...
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
I can't... I'm bad off, Billy. You cut too deep.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
You don't still think it was me?
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
Are you alone in the house?
I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Do you like scary movies?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
More of a game, really.
Or else what?
I believe you...
Turn off the light.
Come on, yes you do.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
Your call.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Mind if I join you?
What kind of lead?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I'll get my camera.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Yes, you doofus.
Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
Afraid not.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
Yes, sir.
What is it? Where's Casey?
Call the police.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
Jesus! The camera-hurry!
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Yes, that's right.
I'll send you a copy.
I owe you shit.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Has his story changed?
Why would she lie about it?
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
And why is that?
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
I can cry on cue.
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
They think it's school-related?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
And you believe it?
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Give it to me.
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
It would be too hard.
Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
NO!
Spit it out.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
We would have gotten you eventually.
Shut up!
What the fuck is going on?
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
No one yet.
Good.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
What?
Tonight.
Like in the Parson's Tale, and Dante.
Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
Nothing.
It's got to be.
Just wait!
Bullshit.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
And so what?
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
Him?
How is this legal?
I don't.  Neither do you.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
It was him.
No point in arguing anymore...
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Kiss me on the lips.
Wait!
What did you say?
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
It's a hard place.
I'm sorry, I only...
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
He mentioned it.
I hate this city.
How should I know?
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
I ain't wearing no gun.
Yes sir...
I don't believe in surrenderin'...I still got my sabre, Reverend...never turned it into any ploughshare neither!
By what you preach...none!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Easy!  It's forty miles, sonny...Horses can do with some grain and a little rest.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
I got your boy killed.
Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
Finish your breakfast...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
Come on, say it.  You know...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Oh God, Tommi...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
I haven't the slightest idea.
Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
Thank you.  Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Does this dog here belong to you?
We can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
It's good.
The title won't do.
Twenty pounds on delivery
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
Ask him.
See you in jail.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
And his ears.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Every word.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
To my weekly confession.
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
Tomorrow
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
How goes it, Will?
Good title.
"Of love?"
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
Verona again.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"Madam!"
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam\85?
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
If they find you here they will kill you.
Well perhaps better than my first. 
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
Orsino\85good name
How does it?
Nor you for me.
My lord.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I do not love you, my lord.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
I am going to church.
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
But not quite.
Just stop worrying.
I want to talk now.
Now.
I don't know.
Security.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
So I gathered.
About the mail --
What?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
Yes, thanks.
Cameron?
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
His car's still there.
Don't look?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
And now you tell me.
That's not him.
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
Then let's spend some money.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
No, no, it's different.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
What are you doing here?
David?
And the money?
Where he can't get it?
It's the only way.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
Oh, shut up, Alex.
What?
You mean I can have the room?
Burglary?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
You're sure of that.
Do you smoke?
Yes.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
No one. I promise.
With a face like this?
I should hope so.
You and me?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
I'm not sure --
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
It's an improvement.
You know about it?
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Is it real?
Chicken salad, Devra!
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
That you were just indulging me.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
My keys.
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
I don't want to see you anymore.
But you don't know what happened.
Calm down, baby.
What kind of treatment?
Whatever you say.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Nobody can hear it.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
No thanks.
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
No thanks.
... yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Why?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
Then what do you think?
I am not!
Right.
Right.
Right, that's right.
I guess not...
No, thanks.
No, I'm sure.
Great.
Whew.
Why not?
Hey, I don't tell.
Yeah?
You did, didn't you?
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
Jackie, can we --
-- what?
You were great.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
It's too late...
What's that supposed to mean?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
-- yeah, this is --
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Where?
Who?
What about me?
Of course I like children.
Okay...  Night, baby.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Commercials.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
I do, Jill.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
What is.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
Yes.
Where did this come from?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Jesus.
What did you say?
-- A wash and set.
No?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
They're not?
Sure.
I know what you mean.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
... this doing hair it's...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Well, what?
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Yes I do.
I'll call you back.
Yeah.
Okay.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
You do?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
I am?
Then you were talking to him.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Who is that?
I know, I'm sorry.
-- No. No really.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
Honey?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- no.
-- oh I don't know --
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Of course not.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Jill.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
No.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Where to, Les?
What was the Donner party?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
What?
No, Dad.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Okay.
Danny, come on over here.
Yeah.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Yes.
Thank you.
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Hmm, nice.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Which room was it?
No, nothing at all.
Yes.
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
Not for me.
Oh!
Thank you, Susie.
How do you do?
Fine.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
For getting a divorce?
What kind of noises?
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
Sure.
You're welcome a million, Marty. Stick 'em in the bushes for now.
You're not going to let it go, are you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
Well... thank you.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
Yes, Mary?
Were you tempted?
Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You can handle this.
You did what?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Yes, Betty?
Oh-huh.
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Just about.  Show me again.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
Whatever.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
You know?  About me?  About everything?
You re okay -- for a civilian.
What?  What time is it?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Excuse me?
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Mary Clarence!
Enough joking.
Very well.
What?
Are you talking about me?
What's a concubine?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
I'm outta here.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
He didn't do you a favor.
Then-you run.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
Maybe Hawaii.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
I think they'd understand.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Even nuns have to pee.
Oh-huh.
A hiding place.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You won't even tell us?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Not... totally.
Which one?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
He's decent.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
A Benedictine.
Impossible.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
I hit him square.
To place it inside its coffin.
You will stay at her side?
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
They need guidance.
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Not for lack of trying.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
I know it.
Up.
The Western Woods.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
True enough.
Business, best hidden is hidden best at night.
Yes.  I rode with him on payment days.
Lady Van Tassel.
Lady Van Tassel...
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
You made this, and the drawings?
If you want.  But...
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What troubles you?
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
What did you say?
Come with me.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
What did you say?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Now it's minimal wage and there ain't nothin' but a army cot and a toilet back there.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Is him stayin' here workin' out?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Give me the big'uns.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
It's too big.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
Please Doyle, don't.
But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
Childers.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
What numbers do you punch?
I aim to kill you with it.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
I thought they was.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, I recollect it.
If you want me to.
He ain't no count.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol' boy.
You will? For sure?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
If I ain't too stove up. I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.  I'm proud of ye.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Okay.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
Yeah.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
No ma'am.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Ma'am?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
Not really to speak of.
Did you knock on the door yet?
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Can I help you, sir?
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
American literature. What else?
Uh...  My friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale.
What's that, Sol?
The Queen of England?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Not a peep.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Hi, Auggie.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Eighteen and a half years.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You what?
And what's that supposed to mean?
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
It's all yours, baby.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Huh?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
And these?
What does that mean?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
I shouldn't have let him go.
Those are pretty hostile words.
Jesus.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Just passing through.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Once you look at it, you're going to want to buy it from me. That's guaranteed. And that's the price: five bucks. So if you're not willing to spring for it, you might as well not bother to look. It'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
What's your offer?
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
Eight-thirty?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
How long have you been here?
I don't know. For helping me out.
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
No way.
The end.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
Here, catch.
Yeah, I picked it up.
It wasn't my fault.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Carl Heine's type.
You don't.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Is that your third question?
You done your math right.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
Oh, in a heartbeat.
And the next one...?
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
Oh, yeh.  He said someday he would get his land back.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Fell.
Maybe...?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
<u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
Get lost, will you?
I thought I made it clear I don't want any drinking in this outfit.
Thank you ever so.
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
Hey, Joe!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
Knock it off, will you?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Shave our legs, stupid.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
You better come help me.
I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Good night, Josephine.
But this is so humiliating.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
He's going to be ashore with you.
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
I don't want you to think that I'm a drinker. I can stop any time I want to - only I don't want to.  Especially when I'm blue.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
No, no.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Half-full.
I may spill something.
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yes.  For a whole year.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Goodbye?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
It's three weeks in Florida -
All right - lets take it from the top. And put a little heat under it, will you?
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Glasses?
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
My fault.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Not at all.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
- Inauguration balls -
Tonight?
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
They just sort of leave me cold.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
What is it?
I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
I never join nothin'.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Big joke!
That's an opera, you ignoramus.
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Charlie.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
There\92s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Except it\92s Scotch.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she\92s getting married.
Um, just about everyone.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Other than, he\92s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
But, somehow, it was Kat\92s arse that was stung by nettles. And you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
Oh, hello.
Shrink, actually.
What?
Um, news flash: I don\92t give a shit.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
I don\92t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Why?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, \93Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.\94 Trust me, I\92m careful.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
It\92s my job.
Make out with you for free.
Yeah.
You\92re judging me?! Oh, that\92s a good one. You\92re lying to me, you\92re lying to your family, and you\92re lying to yourself. But you\92re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you\92ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
What?! No, no. You can\92t--
Of course, don\92t be silly.
Ahoy!
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
That's right--
Colored.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
Nothin'...
She was dirty and wet...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
I did look, Charlie, but I--
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
My father taught me...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
Same as we -- they pray.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Listen, Mama...
Did you find your father?
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
I wanta get some things.
Tired.
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
I'll wait till after the children.
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
I am the clitoris.
Now go, your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here, just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
My head hurts.
Montana.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
But what are we going to do against this entire army?
Okay.
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
YOU DO?!
What Cartman?!
No you can't Kenny!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
I don't know.
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
MOM!!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
FREEZE!!
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
YOU BASTARD!!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Huh?
Yes?
What the hell is going on?!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
I know.
You don't care.
This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Oh yeah...
Anna...
You're Warren Wayne.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
That's clear.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Yeah, but you didn't answer my question.
It was no time to lose my partner. We're going to have to hurry, he's on to us.
That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
Why?  Where are you going?
Marry you?
Try not to think about it.
Baby, take it easy.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
Can I get you something for the road?
Are you guys bruddas?
Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
I'm not on the tour this year.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Thanks.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Clam it!
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
Who's there?
SHEILA!
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
I like the sport the way it is.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Line up where you want it.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
They suspended me.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Coming right up.
No, not at all.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
No. Do You?
Plan B is your dad.
What's plan C?
You're here.
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Tell me what happened Theo.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
At least I'll die smiling.
Tell your little pal to let go.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
It's burning...
I can't see...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread.
How long will that be?
What if it attacks?
What do we use for defense?
Forty yards.
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
He's right beneath us.
Now!
Press?  No, I haven't.
They didn't tell me anything.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Geologists?
-- Wait a second --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It's impossible.
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
Take a look.
I don't know.  That's the point.
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
What do you mean, he's missing?
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
How drastic?
When was this?
-- and then brought her down here --
Jerry?
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
Well, where the fuck is he?
In a minute, sir.
Then how can it be chipped?
So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
What's the message?
She's not gonna know, sir.
What -- you want me to retype it?
Radiation shield, you think?
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
Too big?
What was Edmunds doing outside?
That's quite a secret.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Good theory, Ted.
My gosh, Norman.
Beth --
You did, didn't you?
You don't trust me?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
He what?
It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Squids?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
It's a soporific.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
How fast does it take effect?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
For what?
How's Harry?
You tell me.
Don't you?
C'mon -- what?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
But I have to, Norman.
It's not safe for you to be either.
A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
Wait a second, I --
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Gimme another explanation.
You mean, you think I'm cracking?
Then what, Norman?
What noise?
That far in what, Harry?
What are they?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
Harry?
You know what it is, Harry.
Hold on.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
But it's impossible.
Please.  It must have flown here --
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
The ships?
They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.
What report?
Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
You mean you don't know?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Like what?
You mean a picture?
This is like nursery school.
When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
I'm not sure.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I don't know.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
How can you store an energy field within you?
That's where my father was killed.
I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
He can't find Organa Major.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Did it occur to you they might find us?
We have a little business to take care of first, but it shouldn't take long. We'll be back shortly.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Move out of the way!
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
They'll find its weakness.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
He'll be well cared for.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Death to all bugs !
Yes, sir !
I gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. He is going to go eat it.
Your father will never let you.
I got Games & Theory.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
Yeah, we know each other from the game. No hard feeling, eh, chum ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
You and me, huh ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So who's got time to get married ?
You're upset, that's alright.
You two have so much in common.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Alright, I love you.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
Should I be ?
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
That was just a mix up.
Thank you, ma'am.
No way, ma'am !
Hut... hut !
How come we never got together ?
Sure.
I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
All bands.
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Here in Buenos Aires.
Uh, no.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
Been better, buddy.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Good for you. Go find out.
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir...
What's going on, Diz ?
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
Have a security team meet me at Deck Four main elevator!
Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain...
Permission to speak freely, sir?
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
It's taken control of the computer...!
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,    we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
Our Exec and Science Officer...
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
See that it is.  Take me over, please.
That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Precisely.
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
We're ready, sir.
Tractor beam remains constant...
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
I'll be there.
Sure plan to.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Yes.
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
I understand...
And likewise.
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
Everyday things...yes.
What are you doing?  I love your script.
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  And <u>you</u> get a second chance!
Yes.
What?
"Room Service!"
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
Is it...
But that's what happened.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Morning, darling.
Water or mineral deposits.
Yes, that's right.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
We'll work it out...
What?
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
I loved it...he...
It's...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
Well, what's the beef?
Then what is the...?
But we...
Who is that...?
I...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
Because he understood.  That was her life's blood on the stage.
...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
I know, I know.
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
I can't tell.
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
I'm gonna nail it.
The girl was in the car.
The girl was in the car.
So be it.
For what cause?
I...
I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
You told me you were writing.  Don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
Like dykes and dogs.
That's why I <u>want</u> it.  Type it up and get it back to me in...
<u>Pay</u> her.
Find the money.
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
Look, Carla.  This is a hard time for you.  Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you...
Is he cool or angry?
Sherry, this...
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
...the city council...
Yes, I hear it.
Mmm...
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Ain't no second chances in life.
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I'll ride ahead.  Nelson, protect the Queen...
During sex.
Or blush.  You look pale.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
Here.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
Don't touch me!  I'm <u>allergic</u> to you!
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
That's so weak.
That doesn't bother me.
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
But Rache...
Ice cold water.
Fine.
Then have a donut --
I have lava.
I knew where I was all the time.
What honey?
Thursday's fine...
You have the WORST flu since...
Is your bad?
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
WE are over.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Not personally.
Yes?
Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay?
You're taking the kids.  And moving to San Francisco.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
...go to the park.  In the worst way.
No.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
Feeling the pressure?
And her...?
Give 'em my number.
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Oh please.
And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
Double.
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
No, there isn't.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
For what?
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Rache, get out of th...
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Oh, yeah?
Hey. What's up?
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
I did not go to high school.
My baby.
I am sure.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
Nothing, I guess\85
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
I'm serious! What happens if he blows up the school?
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
What?
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
What's tomorrow?
Oh. What happens now?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
The same.
One in a million recover.
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
What are you doing here?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Thanks.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Eight, six, and four.
I know.
He did?
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
Why? Are we going dancing?
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
Yeah?...
What happened?
Used to Filmore, used to.
Well Cooper...
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
Like where--in your dreams?
Yes, you should.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
How much do they have?
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Moffo!
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
At his office in the Capitol.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
Naturally.  It would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country.  But this way we know it's safe, and we don't have the problem of delivering it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
What?
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
He wanted to talk to General Ripper, didn't he?
That certainly would be a problem, sir.
Yes, sir.
A shooting war!
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
You're damned right they are.
Just a squirt.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Peace on earth.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
I presume the planes are armed?
What the hell is Plan-R?
Why can't you cancel it?
I should say practically none, though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination. The trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations, and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all.
Admiral Buldike?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  The boys in CONCOM do the pencil work.
Naturally I am, sir.
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Give me revs for maximum speed at sea level.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
They're moving apart.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Forget it.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Look, this is different.
I don't get you, King.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
Let me check.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
Was it okay?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
What?
No, uh, nobody. It's, uh, it's my birthday this week and Sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
The dude wants it.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
No.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
Uh, last night...
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Erica is in the van back there.
She's in the van.
Guess not.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Hey.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Yeah.
In what way?
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Are you talking to me?
Good. See you later.
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
I could.
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Hi.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What was your name again?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's a mistake to think that.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Pony and I are friends.
Mm-mm.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Because I'm alienated.
No. We were just gonna go someplace or something to...
Sooze wants to see him.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
That chick, Erica?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Wow. You did that for me?
Oh, Jeff, give me a break. You didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
You don't know?
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Will you just put the gun down?
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
That's right.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
No.
About what?
One!
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Tim!
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-hm.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
I don't know.
Mm.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
Shit, Jeff!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah, good.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Burnfield. No place like it.
Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's stupid.
I'm always serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright!
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Really? What else does your mother say?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
About what?
If you hit me...
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Wayne Gretzky.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
Y'think?
Jack...
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
That was gas, Sweetie.
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
That you?
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Bullets.
It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
Hold on...
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Oh yeah, you caught us...
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
Hi, Artie.
Nothing for Ladd?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
What teacher?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
Why should you do that?
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
Nobody can be that busy.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
What were you -- a child actress?
Second generation, huh?
Was I?  I'm sorry.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
Whose?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Get out!
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
And you'll play Salome?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
I don't know.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Come here!
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Who?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
"Mad about the boy."
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Nothing is the matter.  I'm having a great time.  Show me some more.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Good night.
I think I'll read a little.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Good.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
She is upstairs.
Right with you.
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
What car?
Is that So?
Had to get away for his health, I suppose.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Greatest thing that could happen to you.  Now you'll have to sit behind that typewriter.  Now you'll have to write.
If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
Thank you, Max.
But which one?
No, a super girl.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
It's for your own protection.
Later.
I have to.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why not ?
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Just like that?
It seemed that way to me.
Miss what?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Oh, no thanks.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
You're supposed to guess.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
She's a beast.
Somebody's gotta do something!!
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Throw him out.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Criminals.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Why?
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Better than when I was a child.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
But Lana, you could --
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Me neither...
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Oh. You're going away.
Kent!
What!
Sure.
Oh?
At one o'clock in the morning?
Kitchen. . . Technician
Thirty-five.
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First paycheck?
Who gets it, the company?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
First question got to be "Where."
What are you talking about, fella?
God, that's what I keep you for.
What will it get me?
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
We gonna crash?
Just a second.
And do what?
Anytime.
But the bridge...
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
But the other night...
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
Hey, I know a lot of things!
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
What's wrong?
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
What??
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
We'd better talk.
I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
Let's get you inside . . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
I'm sorry.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Yes.
Now This I want to hear.
Sensible enough.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
Free!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
What shall we do now?
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
I really don't think . . .
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
Something . . . wonderful.
A toupee that flies?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
This wasn't in the plan.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Destiny.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
You've broken all the laws of man, Luthor. And now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  I assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles I hurled into the sun!
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
He's thirty-five years old.
We're running out of smoke.
Lois isn't here?
North. It's north
I will.
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
Don't you ever give up?
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Jealous? Of what?
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Deductive reasoning, my friends! That's the name of the game. What does it say here?
Bingo!
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
We just take it?
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Tea?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I'm wearing it.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
Folks'll ask question.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
He'll be weightless.
Enjoyed it?
It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
You think they're strange?
Uh-huh.
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
I...uh...check.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
It is for me.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
They'll soon be over.
Alison Jones.
How are you?
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Okay.
Yeah.
Goodnight, Nicole.
How?
Why not?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
It's natural.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Sure.
You believe that?
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
From what?
And what's that?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
I didn't say that.
I'll just strap it on the roof.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
I'll...take it straight.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
It's interesting.
I feel like a princess.
That's what he said.
Yes.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
You seem very sure about that.
Thank you, Nicole.
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
So what's the problem?
Well, let's see what we get.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Yes.
Before the actual accident?
Dolores was driving too fast.
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Positive.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Don't even try to remember.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Nothing.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
But Charlene...
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
Is "he" inside?
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
See my mother?
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
No, I wouldn't...
Why, has he bothered you before?
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, I won't...
Can't hurt...
Don't go wild, Sidney.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
But what?
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
It is a favor, isn't it?
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
You tell him, I stutter!
I wasn't looking for a brawl.  I came to bring him a present.  Wanna bite to eat?
Yes, but why?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
What ship?
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
If the stores are open -
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
Steve, stop it please...
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for us?
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
Why?
Right.
No problemo.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
No problemo.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
No!  Don't kill him!
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
Go!  I'll finish here.
You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
Unknown.
Son of a bitch, I knew it!
Please continue...
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
I don't know.
Eating is eating... and...
I don't know.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Some.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Five minutes.
Why not show Dr. Furtw\E4ngler the evidence. It may refresh his memory?
and totally irrelevant.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
That is correct.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
I don't buy that.
It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
What?
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Me? Never.  Never.
Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Yeah?
The Miracle Kid.
Yes, Dr. Furtw\E4ngler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.
Yes.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Alright!
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
All.
Wrong.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
I hate the beige one.

I don't understand...
Freezing.
Kyle.
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
You like it?  It's my first.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What about it?
That's not my mission.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
No.  Never.
It's better that way.
You're not supposed to.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
I can't sleep.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
I just called.
Like shit, boss.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Shut up.
Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Please, don't do that...
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What are you talking about?
You should be.
Where are you going?
It was a gift... from my brother.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
My hero.  Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
Why... ?
Hm?  Oh, yes.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
You?
What's wrong?
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
Scams, con games.  How many?
Nicholas...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Fuck you.
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
That's not true...
Stop it!
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Which grad-school?
Yeah.
No.
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Robbed?
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What is?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
He came to my mind recently, that's all.
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
No.
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Greetings fellow insomniac.
Yeah.
Sure.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
You could have.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
That smell... oh, God.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I don't know.
It was.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why?
Nell.  You will come here now.
No --
How'd I know it was for you?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
She was unhappy.
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Why would we --
I know.
You're okay.
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
No, it's getting worse.
Well?
I don't know, you know...
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
Like you.
Oh, god.
We think?
Okay.
Where do we go?
Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
It was better than a telegram.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Terry Valentine.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
She didn't write to me, did she.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
He's gotta know why.
Uh-huh.
No, but I know what he means.
Not her brand.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Try calling me again.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
That's what was estimated.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
What's in Big Sur?
How do you know?
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
All of what?
He had urgent business in the north.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
You're a reluctant traveller, then.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Five thousand.
Yeah.
Good luck.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Since when?
They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
I don't.
Yes. Thank you.
The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Who?
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Uh--
Yeah.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Well, you know what that would do to me.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
...Huh?
Big Dave--
I, uh...
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Who?
How's that?
So?
Congratulations, Gina.
How are you?
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
He a good man?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
Whuddya mean?
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh? No.
No thanks, I--
Ah.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Why not?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
What's the combination?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
You said the system couldn't fail!
Where the hell are you?
Whose footprints?
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
Apparently it's huge.
The sub-basement?
May I see that?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
I don't know.  I thought Dr. Whittlesley died in South America.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Footsteps!
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Another storage room.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
What kind of hormones?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
Okay.
All right.  If you're positive.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
What are you going to do?
It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
I can't!
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
Why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
What's to see?
All prop cars accounted for?
What have we missed?
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
A window onto the human condition?
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
How do you know?
I made macaroni.
I don't know--
I won't be here Sunday.
What?!
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Things always do--when you look back.
Fine.  I'll tell her.
--How do you know about that?
Were you there--how do you know?
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Me?
Kurtzweil, we think.
You got some kind of business with him?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Yeah, I did.
I know the name. Why?
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
Before the bomb went off?
Not according to the men in blue.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
What did it look like?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully, I found the bomb.
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I can't really talk right now.
Mulder --
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
This is great. This is fitting.
-- of what exactly?!
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Mulder --
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
For the purpose of what?
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
You can't quit, Scully.
Just like that --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
Where are we?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
General McAddie's.
I don't know anything about that.
Thank you.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I'm not taking any chances.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Driver.
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
What happened?
What's wrong?
As far as I needed.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You don't know the procedure.
I did, yeah.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Mocky-Lock.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
Delano?
I'll get her...
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
Gentlemen, I believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
I don't have to.
Considering where I've been...
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Sit down.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He has a little dog.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Yes.
Just another part I've got to learn.
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
Where is she?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
A parrot...Let it go.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
Of course.
They're Harry's.
No.
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
I don't...
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Just around the corner.
I'll carry a copy of one of your books. Harry gave it to me.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Can I have that woman's passport?
Martins.
Once in a while.
No.
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
Calloway.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
In Vienna...
I see.
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
She's right. It's none of my business.
All right, Calloway. You win.
I said you win.
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Take him to Sacher's.
I know a very good dentist.
No, a major, were you really?
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
She's been arrested.
You can get somebody else...
Do you know, I don't ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...Victims?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
What's the name of this girl?
Yes.
I have guests waiting.
In great pain?
English?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What's he saying?
Er, alive? He couldn't have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Who else?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
What else?
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
A novel, Mr. Martins?
Yes.
Okay.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
I don't think so.
Why?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
We're ok.
What!
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
What happened?
Fuck off.
It's on an island that no one get to.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
Two.
Eh - bonsoir.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
Richard, you know something -
Uh-huh.
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
He's an asshole.
Yes.
I don't, but...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
I don't care about money.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Killing himself.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Why won't you talk to me?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Do they?
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
I'll go look....
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'm stealing it.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
They're liars and cowards.
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
Everybody likes to, don't they?
Female...
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
You're lying.
I can't say that.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
Daniel Balint.
From the Rhineland originally.
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone.
Who told you that?
No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
The mother.
Here...
I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Who even knew?
Why? Why would she?
No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Get out of my way.
"Do chickens give milk?"
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
I can't... I just don't know how to...
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
What d'you mean?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Hello!
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Congratulations, Enzo.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
Enzo!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
That idiot!
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Six seconds.
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
He's training.
Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
Noireuter.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Hey!  D'you have any other complaints?  Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
... You married?
People say that?
Not at all!
What?
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... For the mermaids.
Everything about what?
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... I'm listening.
... Yes.
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
We saw each other a little while ago.
It's too loud for me.
Lucky I was there to save you.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
... The way she moves.
How do you know that?
Uh... Ah!  A story?
... Not at all.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
I didn't dive.
... Nothing.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
Louis, we were French!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
But... how is he going to breathe?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
... Yes?
Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission.
It's Esther.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
I said, do you come here often!?
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Yes Esther.
Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Happy Hanukkah Morty.
Now this might get a bit technical, but try and stay with me. Using a highly sophisticated connection of other computators, called the Internet, I can access surveillance maps, villian biographical information, and even sports scores with a few simple keystrokes of this electronic typewriter.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
Maybe he ran out of ammo.
Why not?
I don't know \97-
It don't look like a leopard to me.
Let's get in your truck.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
You found the leopard!
Where? Where did you find it?
That's the place: I remember -\97 My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths \97\97 that's what this procession is supposed to be.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
No.
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
I know all that, chief, and I don't like it any better than you do, but there's something else --
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
And I never will- you know what's between us \97 we're a thing But this is serious competition.
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
We all, had to look at the body. It was awful, Kiki -- awful!
You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
You. Us.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
What! You can't be --
We will \97\97
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:...  Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I\92m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
I guess the news you\92d sent me after Friedman didn\92t go down too well, eh?
No!
You don\92t say.
I didn\92t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you\92d been back.  That we\92d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn\92t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
I don\92t know. Everyone\92s dead...
Europe...  France. I\92m French but I live in London...  ... England.
I\92m fine standing, thank you.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn\92t have any. I used a British passport. My name\92s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
I\92m sure I\92ll find a way.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Who\92s the guy? Who\92s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I\92d have had to kill him.
So who... Who\92s the man? Where is he?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I\92ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it\92ll be too late.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god\92s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Have we done business before?
Tomorrow?
I see. How much?
... Fine. I\92ll go for the safe place.
Jee... Fuck... You\92re fucking mad!
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Where is he?
I don\92t know. I don\92t know, man. I don\92t even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, you\92ve got to get me out of here...
B-Black...
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
Should I?
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I\92d given you and then got back, remember? I can\92t find it. Do you know where it is?
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Didn\92t you say I came recommended?  That\92s what I thought. May I know by whom?
You wouldn\92t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
When... I\92m told he came here...
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy\92s education.
Look, I don\92t think you\92re fully aware of what you\92re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don\92t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
You\92re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy\92s not one of Friedman\92s...
Yeah.
We need a double-room and as I understand you\92re here alone we\92d be much obliged if you\92d agree to move to a single room...
Oh. This is... We\92d arranged to meet tonight and I\92m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Shut up! Where\92s your wallet?
Good reasons?
I\92m afraid I don\92t understand.
Yes...You-you\92re not going to take Shiva away?
I\92m sorry. It\92s just you don\92t look local...
He\92d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... \91Sleeping Beauty\92. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn\92t watch...
... No.
How\92s the boy doing?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr\E9- pubescents.
Alors quoi?
Gluck\92s dead, you sonofabitch!
Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn\92t you know?
What do you think, huh?
Two stiffs and a missing kid followed your visit to one of the London hotels. He didn\92t need your confession...
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as \93Never Forget\94. Over the years we\92re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
It\92s a good guess...
That's a good idea, sire.
Yes, my lord.
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Yes...
So... what am I supposed to do now?
What... what do you mean?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
But it is what I want.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
Not yet!
But... why... what's the point?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Yes...
We want her burned as a witch!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
No no, I'm fine, really...
What about you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
In a village called Domremy.
Last night.
Many things...
Silence her!  Take her away...!
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
You really think she's been sent... by God?
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
I know...
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Yes.  We can pray.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
But my voices... they promised me...
The clothes are not important...
That's now what I meant...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Why not?  He has good teeth...
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
Yes... lots of things!
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
No...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Who wants me to stop?
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but Jurek says they'll let him out.  This is disgraceful.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
Dorota.
He'll be back before curfew.
Just over a year.
What are you doing?
How will we sleep?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Who told you?
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Yes, please.
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
I was listening, Kitten.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
If you need help...
Out of Warsaw. Where?
No, I don't think so?
In the attic.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Szpilman.  Good name for a pianist.
To be deaf?
Baines is packing up?
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I don't want to learn.
You mean in signs?
They are washed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Hello.
You've missed this bit.
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
He'll probably fall down.
At the finish, it's Single Action by two, Fasanella second, Visitation third.  Line on Single Action... 3 to 2. Hell with it, that's no good.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
No.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
Don't worry about it, pal.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Shove off, Duff.
I did.  That stuff I gave him was counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.
Which one?
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
They workin' for anybody?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
What about the other one?
Yes sir.
What do ya want the others to get?
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
You didn't act much like you wanted to learn it.
Neither are we.
If we ever get to it.
He threatened to kill me.
Did he say he wouldn't?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Yeh.
I also gotta win.
Five and call.
Pass.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
But what about all these other people?
Think nothin' of it.
Where's June today?
No.
You move right along, don't ya.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
He hired a dame to take it from ya.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Give 'em a little time.
You got a system, Carver?
Don't think I know him.
Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
No.
He'll never do it.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Is that what it means?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
He's just around the corner.
Don't cry.
Go!
Nothing.
Shush!
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Macaulay.
Where did you hit her?
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Which way did she fall?
Yes, she would.
It's a promise?
And he still wants to marry me!
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Must have been in the war.  That might account for the cane and his limp.
Gilbert!
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
I'm asking you.
I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
No.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Goodbye.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
All right.  All right.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
I thought you said you weren't going there.
So I see.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Go ahead!
Yes?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Yes...
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
I didn't knock Julia off.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Santa Claus.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
That's jolly.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Someone get a doctor.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Want a drink?
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
Looks like a hold-up!
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Not with all your money!
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
It's the only way it makes sense.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
No... no.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
Maybe she has.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
Home!
Y-yes.
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
It's a fortune box.
There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
No, please, not again.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
So we wait.
Move!
Maybe we should split it up now.
I told you; don't push me around.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
Doesn't matter.  Whatever he wanted he didn't get it.  We've got no need staying around here.  It's light enough.  Let's pack up and head out.
We're at war.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I out rank you, that's why.
What if I do?
What about Jaeger?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You don't know John Epps very well, do you?
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
We go, we get rich, we go home.  It's that easy.
Roger that.
You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Wh-what do you think--
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
It's the only way.  We drive!
Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Just relax.
Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
I hope it means something, otherwise...
Is it dead?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Forget Wes.
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
Probably.
And then what?
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
The...the gold...
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Then I'm a rich man.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
How the hell should I know?
Really?
A headache?
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Now you need me.
For real?  A treasure?
I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
Yes!
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, we're not.
Lines up with the map and the photos.
Yeah, we're down.
I think we found something.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
Now.
Looks like dirt.
What?
No!  Don't go.
Don't take anything.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
What?
We're leaving.
THX and me.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
Incredible!
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Why are you so concerned?
I want you for my roommate.
It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
No, I...
That way.
Look more closely.
Too late....stay close.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
No!....
No?
I thought of something.....
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Yes...
Officer Reilly, vice.
No thanks, Bev.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Thanks.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Hey, look--
Look, it's a longshot...
No you're not, you just don't understand them. Here, do what I tell you.
Where you guys at?
Cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
Off the scale.
Close your eyes, feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Don't touch that.
It's from an IRA.
We work fast enough for you?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
A bowling alley.
Security.
Take him!
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Insurance?
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
I don't know...
Look who's talking, old man.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
IRA - instant retirement account.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I promised her she'd be safe.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Diamonds all over.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
No!
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Constantinople?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Nice suit.
I thought so.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
I've got to see you.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
Good day, Doctor.
Now just a minute, Major--
I would like to.
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
Gaston Monescu.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Yes!  Now don't worry!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
What time is your rendezvous?
I remember.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Too much blue in crimson.
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
This used to be my secretary's room.
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
You're hired!
Um-hum ...
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Yes, Gaston?
<u>Adolph</u>?
And you expect me to believe that?
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Yes--uh--
Well--uh--yes and no.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Very well, madame. Thank you. 
How much is your salary?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
That's true.
Well, where is it?
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
The ship will sink.
Hurry, Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
No, but we're making excellent time.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
I know what ice fishing is!
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Is he your boyfriend?
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
I'll be right back.
Right.
I'm so cold.
I can't feel my body.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
You think she was really there?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Would you like anything?
Just tell us what you can --
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Goodbye, mother.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
This is Miss Marsh.
I'll join you later.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Good-by!
You're not very ambitious, are you?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Brett is the name.
Very--your mother?
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Sorry.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
You mean that?
I'll be waiting on deck.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Shortie, look!
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Now you're talkin'!
You take some awful chances.
What is it?
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Why?
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
I should say not.
She did?
How?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
O.K.! Send that!
That's fine.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Do what--
I'll never love anybody else.
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
Somebody's got to do it--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
So what?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
About twelve hundred.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Thank you.
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
Nice voice.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
I don't understand.
Well I'm not so go home.
Beauty, ain't he?
This brand.
I know.  Just did what you had to. That banner and stuff, that's Just Ike.  Don't worry about it.
No...
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Better.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
I'll remember you said that.
No...
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
What?
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
There's no reasoning with him.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
How is he?
Never even heard of anything like it.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You'd die for fun?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Drop his horse.
Hey!  Virgil!  My God!  Morgan!  Hey, Boy!  You look great!  Both of you!
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
I'll be damned...
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
What're you talkin' about?
I know.  And nobody can make him.
That didn't sound like thunder.
Morg, use your head.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Jack...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
Sightseeing.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I'm sorry.
- Four wheel drive?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Who knows? Fog, night...
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Happily.
Three. You? Married?
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I hope so.
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Of course.
Hopefully, it won't get that far.
Sabotage?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
Captain Morton.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
You have to leave -
Fueled and waiting.
...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
Will the cruise set it off?
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Like muddy waters?
Babe Brother.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
Now how far would further out be?
Go back to sleep.
Hush.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Hattie is a different person now.
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
I already have, my dear.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
You can bring ONE toy...
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Where was the last place you left him?
Rocky!  The ramp!
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
You're mocking me, aren't you?
That's why.  Sid.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Look out!!
I can't see a thing!
Heh-heh.
Oh no, Hannah!
She's sick!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Toss 'im overboard!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
He got it, Woody!
Sir!  No Sir!
Uh-oh.
That's right.  Your toys.
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
She'll have to learn.
Finn -
I finished it off.
I've got a present for you...
It was only a mouthful!
Storms?
You're late for breakfast.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
I don't know what you mean.
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
Nine thousand dollars.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
Me, too.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Like I give a fuck.
Yes.
I'm third in my class.
Just watch.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Have you done your homework, honey?
Nope.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
What are you?  A mouse?  Get out of the car and do it.  This is your chance.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I got greedy.  I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off.  That was my mistake. Carl would never be so stupid.
You're breaking my heart.
Yes, sir!
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
What is it you want me to do?
It's possible.
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Shag her senseless.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Can you not go yourself.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
Did you bring the cards?
I'm going home.
think I left something back at the -
Is that a promise, then?
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Oh, really?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Yeah.
And you might get the fucking job.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
You're all hear.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
It was just an idea.
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Well, it's up to you.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
In that case --
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
No joy yet.
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
So what's it going to be?
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
And we can't see a thing. Request you direct us to the coordinates.
What do you know of my pain?
Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Because it's there.
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
I don't understand.
That's great. I haven't sung around a campfire since I was a boy in Iowa. What are we going to sing? What... Bones, what are we going to sing?
Are we leaving, Captain?
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Goodnight, Doctor.
I cannot be certain.
Fascinating.
Captain, what have I done -
Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
He's sorry, See, he's sorry. Everything... that makes everything all right. He's sorry, everything's...
Is what possible?
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
Not possible. You were never alone.
In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
I'll take you to the bridge.
Now learn something about yourself.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
No conditions.
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...


"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
No. You must kill me.
I cannot go with you.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Hi, Flynn.
Yeah...pain in the neck, you know, I was all set
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
You call that getting over it?
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
Not a chance.
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Hah.
Where did you hear that name?
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
Yes.
How about you?
Shhhhh.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Recognizers!
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Come here.
Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight.
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me.
Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Simon?  Ohmygod.
Where are you going?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Yeah, right.
You're kidding.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
What?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Here, check these out.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Will you just open the door!					*
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Son of a bitch!
I still don't believe it.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
What are you talking about?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
The purse is still at the house.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the way in.
Here they come.
Sorry.
You're not going anywhere.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
What'd you do, honey?
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
Answer the question--
Louder please.
Think carefully.  You will be lying to the man you love.  The person who trusts you the most.
No.  Doris.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
You wouldn't believe me.
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going! 
Go ahead.
You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
Nope.
Ya looked through it?
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Now hang up.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
Is that your real name? Really?
What do you do?
Very much. Now, where were we?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Five.
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
You didn't do nothing.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
I don't believe so.
You don't know him -
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.
Has he gotten his mail today?
You goin' out?
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
Really?
What are we gonna see?
Who's Sonny Chiba?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Look, Dick, I don't -
He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No problems on both counts.
I can see what you mean.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
What?
You were a cop.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Who is he?
I got some money I can give you -
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.
Sure was.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Rock whores.
- Because it's good!
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Yeah, I live here.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
They wanted identification.  I don't have any identification.  I wasn't trying to hurt them.
No.
You wouldn't understand.
I have to go.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Clues?  What kind of clues?
When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
Shot!  Who shot you?
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
Yeah, sort of, I guess.  I...I'm sorry I locked you up.  I thought...I thought... I think maybe I am crazy!
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
In the 18th century there was no such thing!  Nobody'd ever imagined such a thing -- no sane person anyway.  Along comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I think.  He tries to convince people... other doctors mostly...that there are these teeny tiny invisible "bad things" called germs that get into your body and make you...sick!  He's trying to get doctors to wash their hands.  What is this guy...crazy?  Teeny tiny invisible whaddayou call 'em?..."germs"!
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
Yes, sir.
You really want to know?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I said I was sorry.
Christ!
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
That's my morning's pay.
Hundred and eight already.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
I don't care, just get me there.
One way.
Harlin around?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
John--
Sheriff Potter.
They look nice.
The wind isn't blowing.
I'm just going to my car.
My name is John.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
No trouble at all, really.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I guess it must.
Those are white words, not ours.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Still playing?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean.  Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
I don't know.
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
What about him?
Wait.  What about . . . him?
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
He was going to--
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
I had a problem getting my car back.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Trouble with the car again?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I've had time to get over it.
You're too quick for me.
For what?
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Not before I settle with you.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Jesus!
Not as bad as it looks.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Sure, Sheriff.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Senor, you need a doctor.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Give it to me!
Bobby Cooper.
Darrell's a moron.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
About things.  About your wife.
I did?
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
And what does that make you?
How do you want it?
It's not what you think, Jake.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
How old are you?
He's up at the Look Out.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
How much!?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You believe that?
Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
When I work on a car, I work on a car.
I'm just going to my car?
It's Grace.
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Those are white words, not ours.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You could leave him.
Nothing.
Try me.
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
Yeah.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
Because I know you're full of shit.
No! You get it!
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
What are you talking about?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Can you make it back up?
'Cause I love you.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
Where to?
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
The ticket is 30.55.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
No! No! Please!
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Wow.
What does that mean?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
No that's it.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
You use your sleeve.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Jesus.
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
In college. A car accident.
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
But not a knife?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
One last question.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
I won't make any noise.
Just one--
I'll help you.
No.
I see.
That's great.
Elijah was wrong.
You're lying.
Jeremy listen to what--
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers?
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
You want... a free one.
I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
Alive?
He admit it?
You boys are off of the Spade Outfit. Got your own string of ponies?
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
Yup.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
What's your name?
I... I guess I might... but like I said, I ain't armed.
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
After a ways.
Shut up, Kid.
Tell me right off if you see him.
You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
Yeah.
Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
You ain't shot.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Two weeks, I guess.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
Sally?
Yeah.
Yeah... you said that last night.
He's dead, Bill.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
Two more hogs got the fever.
I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
The Kid, yeah...
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
What?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Thought you was followin' me.
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Oh, them.  Hell, I seen them.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
How many you killed, Kid?
Plenty of times.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Maybe.
An' if I spot 'em?
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
Just forget about it.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I hope I didn't disturb you.
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
I don't want to know.
Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
What do you care what he says?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
Tough break.
You okay?
Maybe more.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Just do what I tell you.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
Who is he?
Someplace else, then.
Which is shit.
Waste of time.
This won't be an' interrogation, just a... friendly chat to kill time.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
He loved her.
Let me tell you something. I know Dean Keaton. I've been investigating him for three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    + blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force, so don't sell me the hooker with the heart of gold.                        +
Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 + of seven times when he was on the force.                  + In every case, witnesses either reversed                  + their testimony to the grand jury or died                 + before they could testify. When they                      t finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  + five years in Sing Sing. He killed three prisoners inside - one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death. Of course I can't prove this but I can't prove the best part either.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Right.
If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
Give a guy a break, huh?
Why didn't you say anything?
Wait a minute.
But Keaton...
He wanted me to live.
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
You think he's..?
Yes.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
How did you settle on the amount?
Yes.  It would be.
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
No.
Through, through his book.
I wouldn't do it.
No.
I...
I thought I would need it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
I completely understand ...
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
The Doctors were not negligent.
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
No, you did fine.
Yes...I...yes.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Her doctors killed her.
I understand.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Overruled...
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
And what are you?  A cop?
Yes.  It was, actually.
Laura.
I...do you want me to leave?
No...no...
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
I'm going to help her.
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
What?
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
You got a good memory, Franky.
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Yeah.  I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We got to talk.
It's locked.
... You saw her?
I'm going to see you get that chance.
Yes.
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Yes.
Huh.
From whom?
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Do you live here in the hotel?
What about?
You won't have to.
Why?
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Okay.
Tomorrow morning.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
Yes.
No, it's not right.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Ah, no!
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Madeleine died here.
I need you.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
You can't. You're afraid!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
I don't know... Switzerland?
What are you going to do?
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
No...
At...
Where had you been before?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
What?
We have.
No birds live here.
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I'm here, I've got you...
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Yes.
I won't lose you.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Why?
Ah, Johnny-O...
Uh-huh!
Three whole weeks.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
I'll take you home.
You haven't told me everything.
Where?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Wandering.
What is it, a still life?
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
First of all...
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
She's dead.
You're not a team player.
I'm not getting a ticket.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
I'm calling the ambulance.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Have you ever done this before?
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I can't do this.
I don't give a damn.
Later.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know and I'm honored...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Great. Fine. Perfect.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Not tonight.
What is her disposition?
He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
No.
Shut up.
Good God...Good God...
No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity?
What did you ask me?
Exactly! Exactly my point.
Suck my ass.
True.
You have a King fantasy.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
You said nobody would miss her.
You will not screw this up.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
I do.
We missed the deadline.
Yup.
I think I forgot the tent.
What?
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
Who else?
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
Why? What's his problem?
It's vile!
Of course.
Go down where?
Honey I don't have the time...
I'm mad at you.
I'm working on it.
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
Micheal, by accident.
It's too late.
But...
Like how?
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Did she believe you?
A move?
Greenpeace?
Downstairs in the closet.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
What song?
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
So where to on the honeymoon?
It was an accident!
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Who is she?
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Don't go!
Go away! Leave me alone.
Yes, sir. Good night.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Yes.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
Why?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
Do they worry you that much, then?
Don't worry. Nobody's going to disturb you.
I'll be ready.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
I'm afraid.
But, miss ...
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
Catch him and your record's clean.
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on\97line, yet?
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
He was a computer program for crissake.
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Their weapons missing?
You think he's smart?
Got it.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
He hears...everything.
Talk so I can understand.
All my work is my finest.
What do you expect me to do, thank him?
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
I've been in prison, remember?
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
You don't know?
Sid?
Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had...
You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President...
<u>Lure</u> him. 
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Indeed it is.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...twelve years.
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
He's not fine.
Come on.
No, no, no...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
We don't need it to prove out.  We need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
I'll see you at National.
....we landing?
Who would find out?
...that's the general idea.
...<u>nothing</u>...
The Hostages...?
In the yellow ribbon.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
...take a long view.
Eight Days To Go 
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
Get on this, right now...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
...Stanley Moss...
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
Fine. 
...what are we going to do...?
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Where's my pill...?
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
BREAN, SHAKING HIS HEAD.  IN THE B.G., MOSS, DRINKING. THE TV COMES TO LIFE.
...how ya feeling, boy?
...what is this?
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Heavy weather East of here.
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
Who're you working for?
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Why do people go to war?
To preserve their Way of Life.
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
Alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in China til Tomorrow.
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
...uh ... No, that's...
The... 
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
I'm sure they do.
"Freedom."
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Yes, but I, well, <u>you</u> know...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Get on your feet, boy.
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Watch me.
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
Take ten.
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Leopard Skin...
Isn't Johnny Green in the... 
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
Yes.
Surest thing you know.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
I'm just talking about the Hats.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
Yes. 
...of kittens...
...for the beans, yes...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
Oh really.
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Start unloading.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made...
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Allright. Wait here...
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
What does that mean?
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
And what do you want?
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside...
I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows.
Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night.
With Mark?
Hi
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
They seemed, closing by much 
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
A little?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Mom.
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
You guys are being real assholes
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
A ghost?
What does she look like?
Do you have any idea who she is?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
I am.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
She isn't here.
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
I've never even met you.
And then you weren't there.
Very much.
Yeah.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
You must have been very proud.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Yep.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Jody, no...
I don't know.
Jody, she's alive.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
No.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Like what?
I don't know...
I think three...
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
No, no.  I'm just about...  There.
You are...
Yup.
Shhh.
After that.
Of him I think.
But what if something happens?
Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out.
Mmnph.
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
What kind of whispering?
Really?
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
Wow.
Oh, no...
Did you call about the Feurs?
No.  Look!  In the window.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
But then you've been so much better...
Sweetheart--
Then where is she?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Are you glad?  I'm glad.
In the living room...
Stop...
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
Who?
How did she know where it was?
She's gone.
She can't be here without me.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
You don't have to do that.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
But you've not told Michael.
Two what...?
A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Michael, Rowan should -
Nothing was ever more false.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
The lamplight.  That's all.
Better than most, I suppose.
'He'...?
It wes a dream...!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
FAST.
Like this...?
Nooo...  NO!  Stop!
It is from love.
I bring her flowers too.
It's too soon to know.
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
I don't know what you are!!!
Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
You still feel that crazy...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
He fools around with his patients too.
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
That's GREAT!
No.    This is unreal...
That's cause we're below sea level.
Your beneficence.
Lock the door.  Lock it
A bit much.    Lucas.
Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
You bastard!
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
The one on the left - definitely...
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
Sure...
I think I will pass...
Yes, one and a half please.
I don't know...
Then make it stop...
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
No thanks - 
What was I supposed to do?
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
No - I'll have you after
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
Oh...
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Maybe he got promoted.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
These are real, live women?
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Jealousy is so unattractive.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
Yeah? You like?
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Yeah.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
It's okay. You need me?
Some of them have to be automatics.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
Very funny.
It's not up to me.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I didn't forget.
I have absolutely no intention--
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
You never know around here.
Is this an gritty expos\E9 or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
He phoned it in.
Your dad taught you everything.
It's incredibly simple.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
That's refreshingly deviant.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire.
Very ambitious. I like that.
Yellow pages?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Rules are rules.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
As much as possible.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
That's perfect.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
--PEACHES! CANNED PEACHES!
My job. Back off, Benedict.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Eat a power bar.
Kelly.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
What about the blood?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Take your time.
He was large?
Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
You could tell me where you were last night.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
You don't think Sam could've put it there?
We don't know that, Ray...
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
So you were alone.
Did he come in with you?
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
What was that?
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Where's this coming from?
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
No!
What?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I miss Dad.
No you don't.
Where, the mall?
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Stick?
Hello.
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
You can't...
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
That's cop bullshit.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Story's the same, Detective...
The one you bought at school.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
Jim West.
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
What?  President Grant is...!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
You tell me.
Would that include me?
You bring the best out in a man.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
No, sir... just a businessman.
Restrain yourself, Voltaire.  He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
He had a pressing engagement.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
They're coming.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Then come with us.
Me?
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Why not?
You're not a woman.
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I don't believe you.
I have no family.
Good.  How long will it take?
Why.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Farmer.
You hear trouble.
Friend of yours?
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Who?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Absolutely not.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
What do I need for that?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
John, why?...
It's been a while.
Okay, Mr. Book.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Who else knows?
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Two days.
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Oh. The bullets.
A real fireball.
I know.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Aren't you? After today?
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
No... No. It is just the English way.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
You'll be hist...
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Do you presume to criticize the....
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh!
Hickory!
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh -- yes.
Uh-huh.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Oh --!
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh! Oh!
Oh --
Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Lions and tigers and bears!
It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
It's pleasant down that way, too.
Ohhhh --
Ohhh --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
What?
Yes --- there.
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Leave her alone!
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Who at?
I -- Oh --
What was that?
Fine.  He's got a plan
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
Why don't you try counting sheep?
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Yes.
Ho -- ho --ho
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
It's a whozis?
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Oh --
Oh, no!
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
Well, I --
Help!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
I did kill us. She thinks we\92re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Elektra King.
Elektra would control it all.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
She\92s not a girl anymore.
Renard.
The inside man?
Indeed.
Funerals aren\92t exactly memorable.
It\92s the only way out...
I have to go.
Someone wants to kill me, I\92d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance, James. Now I\92m looking for a bigger thrill.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, I\92m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family\92s, now it\92s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
Have some of the rat\92s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
What\92s your business with Elektra King?
A rope!
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Could...could you come?
Please.
Your father...
Of course...
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
It\92s heading for the oil terminal.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
God isn't there to do it.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
Cured, yes.
Veidt\B9s complex.
What is it?  How does it work?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
What if you\B9re wrong??
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Where did he go?
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Coward.  Giving up.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian.  It\B9s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
We should get back --  What?
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
I don't know their real names!
Am I free to go?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Ever see one of these before?
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Who says you're the good guys?
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
"Anarchy" 99"?
He gets to be the hero.
Mind your business.
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
You don't have to do that.
You can't talk to it?
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
That's would be me.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
That one I'm real familiar with.
Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Is this what you're looking for?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Had to do what I had to do.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
We all do.
For what purpose?
We have to find Magneto.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
It's too far.
I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
By reading my thoughts?
What if they're naughty?
He's busy right now.
He takes his work seriously.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
Senator?
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Gosh, I hope so.
What do you want?
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
Deal.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
She borrowed your power to save her life.  When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts.  In your case -- your ability to heal.  That's why she keeps her body covered.
Enough for a test.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
Poppycock!
Now wait a minute!
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
Well... yes.
Of course.
Yes.
I promise.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
This is the only library I know of.
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No.
Home.
Could be raining!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
If you like -- just hurry!
Well, I don't like to see you mope.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
Act casual!
How do you know it was a 'he'?
What???
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Yes, thank you.  It wasn't bad.
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Well, this explains the music.
And look at this, Doctor!
Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...
I think I'll...carry him.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
There must have been someone else down here then.
His schwanzstucker.
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Four
I listened extra careful to your "Stand To" this mornin', Boy. ft was peifecL I couldn't 've done it better meseif, not even when I was Bugler to The Duke Of Wellington.. .now tell me, where did you get that black eye?
So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
But will they make good use of them?
Thank you.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
