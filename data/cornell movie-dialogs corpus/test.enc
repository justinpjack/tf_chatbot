Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
But
do you listen to this crap?
The "real you".
She okay?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
In 9th.  For a month
Why didn't you tell me?
Patrick -- is that- a.
Who is she?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What makes you think he'll do it?
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
You told me that part already.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
What's the worst?
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
How'd you do it?
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
You and Verona?
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
What'd he say?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
You didn't
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
What's this?
Why'd you let him get to you?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
A soft side? Who knew?
Then you screwed up
No.
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
My grandmother's .
My insurance does not cover PMS
As a parent, that's my right
Which parts?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Tempestuous?
Say it
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
I haven't given you much of a life.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
I have to explore the mainland.
You defend yourself admirably...
All I have to do is call the guards.
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
What are you saying?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
The ocean is uncrossable?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
What's he doing?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... Into a monk...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Don't say anything.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
...delusions and paranoia.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
What are you asking me?
You better get packed.
What are you doing?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
I don't even watch TV.
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
I'll come with you.
My folks are.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
How many victims are up there?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Okay, til tonight.
You promise?
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Okay.
Thank you.
So what's unique?
Any chance we can do that again?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Where's your partner?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
We are both from Prague.
Who is he?
Speak English!
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
I did.
Why not?
What is that?
Let me get a shot of it.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
I speak English.
What was that?
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Well, he killed my partner!
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Mouth's clean, too.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Hi. Frank... coming in, please.
Okay. 
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
Well, that's something.
You're kidding.
Hal?
It's the last one.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
CONTINUED
Are you coming to my party?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, thank you very much.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
That's right.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Thank you.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
That's true.
That's true
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Where's ganz?
You lying son of a bitch...
You got a name, cop?
Yeah, I noticed...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Luther was part of the gang?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
We eat when I say we eat.
Last night.
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
You made that move, huh?
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
We split 50-50?
Right, partner.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Where's luther?
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
It's late, they're closing...
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
What the bell happened?
What a screw-up.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Billy Bear...
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Maybe you ought to buy me one.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How do you know?
Hey...
Instead of worryin' about Reggie, you better worry about me...
Come on, you can trust me. Please.
How about some ammo?
He's a she!
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Is there anything that can stop it?
What are we going to do?
What's she doing?
They really made her...
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Where's Leeloo?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Uh... at least fifty.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
The Fifth Element...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Yeah?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
To save the world.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Apipoulai!
Which one?
You get that off the screen?
...Like love...
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Thanks..
This is all that survived?
Talk English Doc.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
I want your best man on this!
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
...Not far, now.
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm not accusing you...
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
What happened to you?
Tom...
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
What are you talking about?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
You brought the money?
Friend of yours?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Who is Machine?
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Do it.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
Big date tonight?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Truman Capote.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
What about me?
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
You don't need to be here.
What's this?
As you know, my husband passed away recently.  Two weeks ago now.
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I'm sure it is.  It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke.  More than likely he never even watched it.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello... ?
Hello?
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV.
What was she running from?
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Are you religious?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
How... how can you say that to me...?
Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Rick...I can't.
You alright?
I'm sure they're around.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
What the hell was that?
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Hey, Rick!
I don't get it.
Nice neighborhood.
Been up with Alice.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
Feeling better now?
You don't get it, he's after me...
Hey...wake up.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Where is he?
But how...?
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
He sure loves to stay awake.
Who's Jacob?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Dave - !
Excuse me, Skipper---
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Now they feel it...down below.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
That's a <u>face</u>???
He did!
You got yourself a computer, Alma.
Always has been.
What are you boys up to?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
This spring.
You see it?
He's on to us!
We bought you.
I used to play ball.
They said.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Saw him do it?
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
You know.
Did you do that when you were a kid?
It's fun.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
It's pretty old.
What do you want, then?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
You're a policeman.
Don't go playing policeman.
You don't want the extra police pay?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Something bugging you?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
You okay?
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Then... I guess you have to.
What happened?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
I'm not finding fault. It's a good idea, good for you, good for the town. Real modern too.
Rolfe.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Yeah.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
The night before the shooting.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.
You don't want to say hi to your father?
I don't drink coffee.
Alice!
Daddy...
How you doing, sweetie?
It's cut.
Sir, you threw out page two.
Can we do that?
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Air Force One, this is AF-135-RA. We have been instructed to refuel your plane.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
There goes your ride.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Sir, we stay with the President.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
I miss you. And I miss her.
How did your speech go?
What are you doing?
Did they say anything about my family?
What's going on?
It's bait.  Don't take it.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What?
What is it, Mary?
Elaine.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
What are you doing, Ted?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Are you afraid?
Now!
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
My career is shot.
That's not possible.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
Can I hold him?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
You can't go in there!
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
No.  I mean your relationship.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Elaine!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Ted...
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
See them, Elaine?
Airsick?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson. Forget you hip waders, big guy?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Back off, George.
Screw you.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Who is he?
Was.  Divorced.
There is so much our two peoples don't understand about each other.
She's going to divorce me.
Stop the car.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
You think this is the guy who did it?
That where Anderson worked?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
Hope their plumbing's the same.
How can I go?
HOW MUCH TIME?
Ripley...
Have they located my daughter yet?
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
That's right.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If I go.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Save it.
We got problems.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
It's game time.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --
Hicks, don't let him leave.
All right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of CN-20 down there. Nerve gas the whole nest?
Looks like it stung him.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Range twenty meters.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
What did you say?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
How do you know?
Did you know? Had you heard?
No! I won't have him back.
Now?
No! No! No!
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Why not?
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Tish-I'm tee. What's that?
Tish-I'm-tee.
Yes!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Who was that?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Really?
Originals?
These are originals?
Alone.
It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight.
Am I interrupting something?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Hey!
Upstairs.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
I said play!
My pleasure.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Why not?
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Your Majesty!
Oh, thank you.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Would you tell me why?
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, sir.
Yes, what about him?
Why are you here?
Do you always live like this?
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Why not?
No, really!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
What?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
What?
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
I'm sorry. No.
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Strange!
The Fire.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm.  The first bassoon and tenor trombone -
It couldn't be simpler.
And that's all?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
You mean in Turkey?
That will do, Herr Mozart!
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
What do you want?
Are they?
All Vienna has heard that.
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
What does he want?
Can we come in?
Go about your duties.
What exactly did he call out?
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Yes.
Surely you're not suggesting...
He's here.
No, why?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Call me David.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I was. What are you reading?
What do you dream about?
How old are you?
I'm twenty-seven.
What?
Are you better now?
The bedroom.
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
David, what are you doing?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Hello, Benjamin.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
All right, you two, move along.
Now see here young man.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Are you cold?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's a wolf's head.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Could be a lot of things.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
What's the plan?
Oh shit. What is that?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Nice to see you.
Thanks a lot.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're not real.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Hi, Jack.
Because this must be stopped.
I could hang myself.
Dr. Hirsch?
What can we do to assist you?
Hello, there. What can I get you?
Oh.
Remember the Alamo?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
He has?
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Charlie!
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Say, you can't do that\97
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks\97
Oh! Oh, no!  I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals\97  I think I will have a drink.
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Excuse me\97
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Longer.
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
Oh!
Helen!
Got my letter?
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
No. I won't.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
You're lying!
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
Why?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Dude Finlay?
\97for the rheumatism, you know.
What time was it?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
You can ride like that?
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
He's smiling.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
I'm sorry, Cole.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
Beg pardon?
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
You shut up now, boy.
Ride with me, cousin?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
Thanks for the help.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Dammit!
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Well?
Cannon or Gatling?
Jesse.
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
How'd it go in there?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
And we're good at it.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Uncle Frank?
Riders --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Jesse, is that your hand?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Not if I find the right girl.
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No, ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Yep.
I don't understand.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Let me see that.
Tennessee?
Did you order our houses burned down?
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
You cocky little bastard.
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Not at all.
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
Patrick?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
Get married. Have a wedding.
He's rich.
He has a great body
I want a firm commitment.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
You're really serious, aren't you?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Because he dated her.
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I think you should go now.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
That's Paul Owen.
Jeez. That's not a helluva lot, is it?
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Dorsia.
We are totally booked.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Jean?
Anywhere you want?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Want a bite?
What...No! Put it in the carton.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
Where are you?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
So, what do you do?
A model? An actor?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Yeah.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Your address?
Pardon me, but are you okay?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Yeah...Yale thing.
Do you feel that way?
He had a yacht?
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.
What?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Listen, what's your name?
Shhhh...it's okay.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
It's important.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
He's your boss. He's not your --
They hack into people's programs?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
Right. Wait. A toast.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich\E9 about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt.  Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Who's that?
Cool!
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Did you?
Been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler. And it came over me: it's in the wrong place.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Okay, #2.
I think you should go.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
...Were you?
Did you wanna be alone?
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Do we post it on the Net?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Why were you so careless?
Thank God.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Does he know you know?
Why?!
Maybe it's the satellite.
Is that how Larry feels?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
Did you tell Alice?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
What is it?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Oh, yes you are.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
No, did you use a condom?
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I'll hurry back.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Commander, I have to log it...
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
What is it now?
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
You didn't...
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Red ...
... death ...
Flower ...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Quite a collection.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
People, too.
Who?
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Then what's stopping you?
I was about to throw in the towel.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Steed, we really must be --
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
But why? What's the point?
And I suppose you're the knight.
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Steed ... !
Was I?
To kill me?
Because you always obey orders ...
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Our chaperon.
You don't believe him?
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Privately owned by ...
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ...
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
This man -- did you see him?
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
I was hoping you could tell me.
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
You with Mother or Father?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
You're better than I expected.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
That's what we're going to find out...
All right!
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Great car.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Hello?
Nice shot.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
No, Cole, I...
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Let's go.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
You want to share it?
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Oops!
I'd love that.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Mrs.?
Where'd she go?
Reach out and snort someone.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Wash it to the windows?
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
-- He killed people --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
Been ripping off fire stations?
People actually used to pay you for this?
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Ya love it, probie?
Roll the hose.
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
It's okay, Stephen, I --
I saw it.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
How do you know?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Brian.
Huh.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Okay.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Thanks for the invite.
Brian. What's wrong?
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What'll you do?
I'll see ya around, huh?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Oh Jesus Christ...
I need another one, sir.
Are you still here?
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
-- Shhh.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
What the hell are you doing here?
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Your brother was a good man.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Firehouse.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Where's Sean?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
It's not the drugs, Ariane, it's -- it's someone who wants to kill me.  You gotta believe me!
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
Are you all right, honey?
I forgive you.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Everybody say Ho!
My name is Honeycutt and I want to try something different.  Can you do this for me?
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
We're ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Seconds and thirds, too.
Please, have a seat.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
What do I have to do?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Do you know what C.P. Time is?
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
Go away, unless you got my money.
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
I love you too, Daddy.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
Manray!
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
I'm in till the end.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins.
Just want to say good luck.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Not her, the one with the little...
...not that time...
...perfect...
I fell out of my bed last night.
You don't read, do you?
Maybe you need to start.
Stop playing me Sloan.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
For whom else have you worked?
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Then you yield to me.
Never.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
May I be quite frank with you?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He loves me, as I love you.
He is the only one unaccounted for.
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You did Basic here?
That'd be my reaction too --
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Jesus, what happened?
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Bullshit.
His chest was hamburger --
A test will no doubt link you to the killing --
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Pike killed West, Dunbar killed Mueller, Childs, and Nunez.
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
Move him.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You're off to a late start.
That was kid gloves?
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Why do you care?
Buttfucks the cabin?
For what?
This isn't the time --
Your phone number?
I don't think I want to hear this --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
We just want --
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Who, Levi --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out?
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Will.
How would you describe him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Yeah.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Karl.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
I thought you weren't dying.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see...
The river.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
It's unbelievable.
I'm sorry.
I was drying out.
Wait! I need those!
Are you Jenny Hill?
How did you know my father?
I'm going to get started on dishes.
Mmm.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
You first.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me \A3150.
What's this?
What?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Hello.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Right.
So?
Tell me what he said.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In the world.
I do. I want to very badly.
Where's the restroom?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Oh Jesus.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
What?
I don't know.
You know you can come under the blanket.
It's not mine.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
Is the flight full?
You have excellent English.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
More cough syrup?
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
Holy shit.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
I deserve better than this.
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Let me say somethin' first...
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
You take it straight?
Want another?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Shit. Who hasn't?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Heard about this morning.
Keep the change on that.
I skipped lunch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
I feel better. Do you?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
What happened to your face?
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
I think she got to you, pappy.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
What'd you say?
I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Joyce can be nice.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
"Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
Why the hell not?
What happened?
What'd I tell you?
Nick...
I'm not drunk...
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Where does this Sugai live?
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
You all right?
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Ich said you left.
And I'm supposed to care?
Where's the wife?
They want your autograph.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Keep the change.
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
How big a package we talking about?
One guy do all the damage?
Your plane leaves at six.  Two officers will escort you.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
You trust me?
Good.
What's the point?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
And what can he do for you?
Would you like to be modified?
I want more life, fucker.
But not to last.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
You're our best and only friend.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I want to do it.
I didn't like her.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Yeah.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
What about a summary then.
Not if it works.
One more, eh?
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
What's that?
What if you change your mind?
You sure?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
What the fuck for?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In your opinion.
Is there anything else?
How are you doing?
What do people do in the afternoon?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
This feels stupid.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Bad?
How many questions did it take?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
Same thing.
But I understand what you mean.
You want to go home?
What about friends?
Beautiful.
Bravo!
This is my new friend...
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Please excuse this interruption.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, I'm lost.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
I came on a bus.
Right.
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
It's Perry!
How's that?
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Thank-Q!
I think it's the eyes.
What?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
This is for me.
Yes.
It didn't used to be that way.
When do you need her by?
In the house?
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
What about her?
That's ridiculous.
There.
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Are you all right?
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
These are wonderful.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
You're sure?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
No.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Why not? He has great pants.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
The recovery is very impressive.
Why did you park way back there?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
And thanks for always being happy!
I don't see anything!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Hello.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Dad!
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
We have to go.
This is your bedroom?
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
It's time.
No.  They all do.
Days??
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
What's that noise?
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
Oh, no.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
No.  I think it's just right.
Why?
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
If we still have one.
In the generator room again?
Yes, yes it is!
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
I forgot some of my stuff.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Well, what do you think?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
He go back to the hotel?
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?!!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Oh, no!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Anything you can tell me?
Why do you do it?
What is this? What color is it?
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
That oughta do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Do you like talk like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Falling.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
Oh no.
Hello, baby.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
Hello?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
What time are visiting hours?
Yeah?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Can I use the car tonight?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Well.
How ya doin' Dad?
Oh yeah?
What else is new? Right?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
I guess I'll see you sometime.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
So, what's next?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Did you see her undressed?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Okay.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Just for him?
Hey, I just...
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
You think they sold me out? No way.
Yeah, well...
What the fuck are you doing?
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
Hello.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Yeah, we promise.
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush.
Absolutely not.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
That was way easier than I thought.
So what do you think?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
So, what do we do now?
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.  Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Who the...
Chief, what the fuck is this?
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Roc. You okay?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
What is it my son?
I guess not.
I believe these young men are right.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Father, I'll do you right here.
Just be natural, goddamit.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Continue the joke.
Why?
I'm lookout.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
There's another stocker, right?
Yeah.
Can I get that credit card from you?
Why not?
Yes, they are.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
May I have a word with you, please?
They don't?
He needs to hire an attorney.
Obviously. That's a given.
He went back for his brother.
When'd he tell you?
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
She doesn't need to know.
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
I had to give some to Inez.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You could give somebody a concussion.
Shit, Dignan.
Next week we'll be drinking pi\F1a coladas.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What's happening? What's going on?
Who tripped the alarm?
Come on.
What?
Like amnesia.
You think Applejack knew?
Does it float?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
You mean a safecracker?
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
No, that door over there.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Where you going?
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Were you born in Mexico?
Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's my responsibility.
This is natural.
How much is there?
Bob, will you please listen?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
You said 48 hours!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I couldn't hear anything.
Do you have your own cell?
How's that 700 bucks coming?
How you doing, Bob?
How long do you have to go?
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Why?
Why did he go that way? 
He left his sweater.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. Just pool.
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Had to be done.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Show me again...
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know I'm not.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
-- car keys?
I'll get the book.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I wanted to kill him.
I know it's a dream.
And you got to him before we could.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
Who?
Don't need it. I remember everything.
You didn't answer my question.
This is everything? Is there.
Mr. Nevins?
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Amnesia?
Good luck.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Yes. In that order.
Someone dead from this household?
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
What are they doing?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
Peace?!
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I'll wait... back there.
We make spears. A hundred spears. Fourteen feet long.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
That's just a dream, William!
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
They're coming!
Can you do it when it matters? As it matters in battle? Could you crush a man with that throw?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
Then when?
I'm dreaming.
Why did you?
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Why? What for?
You'd be surprised how often they are.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I don't know... I don't remember.
Why do you ask?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
I don't know. These things take time.
There must be a way to fix this.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Dad lives here?
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Where are you now?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
Get out. Both of you.
Oh God... what did we do?
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Not since we were kids.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Ha! Where's that?
I don't get it.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
And you are...?
Smells like sex in here.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Shut up, Tommy!
Here you go, buddy.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Goodnight.
Yes, I come.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Here you are.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
What do you want for Sam?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Rick?
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
A franc for your thoughts.
Yes?
My German's a little rusty.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Yes, of course, we --
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Please.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Put them on the table.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Hello, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You are very kind.
Goodnight.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Yes?
Did he give any reason?
Ilsa, I --
Are you ready Ilsa?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I beg your pardon?
Well, this might come in handy.
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
But we made a deal.
No. It's all arranged.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
I believe you have a message for him?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
It was a combination of all three.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
He is traveling with a lady.
I have my orders.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Where were you last night?
Will I see you tonight?
Make it official, if you like.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
I would advise you not to interfere.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Rick! Rick, help me!
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
It's bad.
Do too little you'll die.
No more water, you said.
No.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
You know what happened to this?
Oh?  You've tried?
Keep painting.  Promise me.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Yeah, a long one.
Sonofabitch!
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
This isn't working out.
That's your dog.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
If I'd known you were alive --
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
You're Chuck Noland.
But chickens?
What happened to your pants?
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
How'd it go?
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
How about we go somewhere else?
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
Digital laser readers.
Take your time.
That's what it's about.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
And that I can drive a truck!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
I've never seen a lobster.
I know.
So. Not bored yet?
And what did she die of, exactly?
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
*What* will be okay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
That's true.
Did you grow up around here?
Uh... it's the end of October.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
They're migrants.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
First pregnancy?
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I don't think so.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I thought it was my turn.
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
Uh... sure.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
But you don't look very happy.
That's *it*?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
The Anti-Christ?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
I can see why you liked her.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Who's that?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Masters of our own destiny.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Minus one.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Come here. Feel this.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
No.  What's my cut?
And some new clothes.
He's gone.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
What about...
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
Why?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
And we got rid of the red head.
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
I know it's policy, but...  The thing is... It's our first anniversary and we're only in town for the weekend. It's a very, very special night for my wife and I. This ring is my gift to her and I think she's going to really love it. I can give you phone numbers to call for people who'll vouch. I can send you I.D. later...
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
Just a tip.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Did he buy it?
You guys awake?
Who?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
My car's in the garage.
You're shaking.
I got scared.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Ouch.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Hi-ya... I'll call you back.  Now then...
I found her in bed with someone.
It came my way. 450 a week.
How did it go?
You're shaking. What is it?
I loved it blond.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
You're my conscience.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
The door, Jack.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Nothing about you.
What?
Oh hello.
Which side do you like?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Next time it'll be my neck.
I'm sorry.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Where do you live, Jack?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
What are you, a cop?
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
Rough day?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Where did you go to school?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
I just want the job.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another twelve thousand rotations. It'll spiral in toward its sun, and --
It didn't go off.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You are false data.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Why don't you have more time?
Yes.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
What are you gonna name it?
Veil nebula.
-- automatic channels open --
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle! Help me.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Man, you got a bad attitude.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Can I say something in my defense?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Damn... Are you alright?
Sophy?  Are you okay?
Soon, baby.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
You got a lotta nerve.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Your basic hodge-podge.
I'm sorry.
Well, not me personally.
With your help.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
None.
Look, I don't know what you want--
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
Yeah.
A long time.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
And she bought that?
Make the call.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Hey, Sketchy--
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
What happens if you level with her?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
What about this?
What the hell is that?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.
Pick a song, Hawk.
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
Jeremiah?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
Any luck?
Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead.
Shit, that dork is Jam.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Cool.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
It was stolen!
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
They're not idiots.
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
No.
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
What do you want?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Two hundred bucks?
Gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
I feel bad for his family.
When can I squeeze one out?
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
Dea ex machina...
Who is... we?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
They suspended me for two days.
What? How long was I asleep?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Is that a cellar door?
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
You're my only son...
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
What's "Cellar Door"?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
What is her name?
Who is the boss?
How many times have you seen Frank?
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
People get hurt.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Regret.
That I did it again.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
How much are they paying you to be here?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Kitty...
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Is Mom okay?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Go on! Get out!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
That's it, I'm goin'...
This, this... This is bullshit!
Here, I didn't get any.
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.
Are we on "Cops" again?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Girls check in, but they don't check out.
What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too.
Lester?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Gladys -- Gladys! Look out!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
So, remember the three most important parts of a good interview...
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
This is -- what?
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Here I am, Father...
Father...
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Well - what is he now?
Half watch dog?
I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
What other job you got?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Are you getting tired?
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's even a greater honor.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
What'll I do with this card?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Did it go well, darling?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Don't!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
I want my man back.
Good morning, Treves.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
You are quite right, Treves, this is an exceptional case. And I quite agree that the committee should see Mr. Merrick.
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Are you comfortable here?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Tell me about it, please!
Romance!
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Thank you very much.
Yes.
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm.
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Ohhh...
Who are they of?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
The workhouse.
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
Please! Please! What are those?
What?
I've never LOVED anybody!
You're as bad as my father.
Halfdan the Black.
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
The second note.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
But --
How do we know this is the way?
A lot of people like our singing.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Why should you care?
Why should you care?
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with making friends?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
Slower! In... Out...
It's magic.
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Thank you VERY much indeed.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
You need to say a bit more than that!
I think we should go...
Wait, Erik!
Well, what else do we do?
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
What are you talking about, Erik?
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
What's all the panic about?
How did he do that?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
What?
Together we stand!
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
It's a tradition.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
And something to sharpen them with?
Shit. The last time I saw you.
And I just liked you so much.
May I help you?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
I'm so excited. Yay!
I'm sorry.
Why what?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I like it.
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
You like that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Ready for another?
Well, I should probably get going.
No. I --
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Let's talk about it later.
I don't think we're ready.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
Such a beautiful view.
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
Happy Birthday.
I scoured the city for it.
Do you remember what we talked about?
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
Hi there.
You said...
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
So you'll call me, right?
When?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I should maybe talk to you.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Hey.
Oh.
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Mary...
Okay, we're back in.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Oh, hi.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
That's Jellybean!
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
What do you think?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
So now you're bummin' around?
Hitchhiking?
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
I can see why they sent you along.
Holy shit...
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
It's holding... She's holding...!
I don't know what happened to Justin.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
What's happening?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Do you hear it? Right there.
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please...
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You're not seriously considering sending him?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Justin, finish your sweep.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
What's the hold up?
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace.  Until now.
What does it say?
I can see that, what're they for?
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
Any survivors?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
The "Other Place," what is that...?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only... NOTHING.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Now what?
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It tastes bad.
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Miller...
You've got to listen...
Weir can't be alive.
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
No. I saw nothing.
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Hey...
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
30 hours to Neptune orbit.
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
A straight line.
Could it be the crew? If they were in suspended animation, wouldn't that effect the scan?
Claire is your wife?
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
Ben, come in.
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Isn't that your speech?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
What the --!
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Reed?... Sue?
Hey! That's a prototype!
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
What are you doing --
They're ready for you, sir.
How's the IPO?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
That's good. That's uh... good.
For science.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
Ben did this?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
'Scuse me.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
Hi, Brad.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
I'm just guessing.
Are you still a virgin?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
It's definitely your mama.
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is gonna shit.
How's it going.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
I want romance.
Not coming? What happened?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Mr. Spicoli?
You just ripped my card in two!
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Where do you feel like going?
Are you really nineteen?
What's your other question?
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
I don't know.
...I've got to go home.
I made a fool of myself.
Hi, Mark.
Anything to drink?
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Killed?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Rum and ice, please.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
What do you mean by that?
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
How long do I have?
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to...  He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him!
What are you talking about?
That's what gives me The Fear.
What limes?
What tape?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I want that fucking radio!
Jesus.
The cops?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
WELL? What are your plans?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
May I see your license.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I will not die because of him!
You know where it is?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
I think I know where a CB is.
Oh!
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
They're right here.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Scared?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
Your parents of relation?
We're going to get help.
What is this?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
Nine?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Bullshit.
Got 'cha!
'Eh, Chief?
Fine, Chief.
NO, but I will lock you in.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
OH JESUS!
Well, maybe they migrate?
What's wrong?
Let's go.
Go! Go!
Are you lying to me?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Look, Frances, I didn't want this job. Think I'm crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please... lemme try, huh?
Frances?  Oh no.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
What does Clifford say?
You learn your lines?
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you a drug addict?
Of course.
I know that, Dad, but --
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Bread?
I'm going back to the hotel.
See you next weekend?
Kurt!
Age?
Why?
Aren't you ever going back?
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Frances...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Jesus.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Serious, huh?
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
To quarter-horses.
You give up on her?
Where to?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Pretty morning.
Yeah.
...Is that not true?
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
Mama...
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Don't... talk crazy.
Haven't you heard what I said?
Where are you going?
You're not going anywhere!
I don't believe so.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Soon?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
Poor William! What indignant tears!
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
You dance so beautifully together.
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
What kind of God is He to will this?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Brother and sister still?
Our decision. Together.
I've no choice
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
What sort of task?
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
It's going to ram us.
A warming wind.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Are you having me on?
Henry Clerval.
Now you've got him started.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You're making a scene!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Yes? And?
Quite a place.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
I have always loved him.
Paracelsus?
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
How is it you come to be here?
The killer is still out there.
What'd you see?
Good night, Alice.
Any particular reason?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
I'll go check on Brenda.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
You said we were special.
You saved my life.
What is it?
Roll him over!
What hath God wrought?
Ow!
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Mmmmmmmph?
Best over...
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Anything else you want?
I mean...
What was that?
Twenty-eight.
What are you gonna do?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Is this real?
Why'd ya quit?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Who else?
It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
That happens, you'll get it back.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
I'm going for 'em!
How many bullets left, kid?
Should I use the last bullets on us?
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Whiskey!
Yeah?
I gotta figure a way to get across that goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain't worth a shit.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Richard!
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
How?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.  But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT?
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Aw, what is this...
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
You know him.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
O'Neil?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
The Navy Cross...
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
No shortage of suspects.
"In Washington..."
Which is guy-speak for...
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
Do you, uh, know...
'Cool?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
O'Neil...
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Clear.
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
I take it this file is still open.
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
Who the hell are all these people?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Don't you think we have enough?
Think we can fit up in there?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Are you okay?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
My life sucks.
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Really? A girlfriend then?
Not for a long time, now.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
It's the French Secret Service.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
About this much.
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
What's happened?
He's a miserable twit!
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
Alex you can't -just leave.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
I don't know.
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Hi Brandon.
Yes but, we were wondering-
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
No, I'll kill you. .
As good as Hopkins?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, they're so cute.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
More to the left... Stay parallel...
What?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
But I'm the Commander!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Thank God. Are you okay?
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
Unbelievable.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
I... certainly, but-
You... You mean Earth?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
Then how did he find out about the device?
Commander...
Mathesar? What is that?
"Deception..." "Lies."
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Continue forward, sir?
I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property.
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits!  It's becoming the American way!
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Well, what have you thought?
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
I'm so inclined.
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Colonel Charles Lee... Hounds and all.  Quite the character.  He's got a tremendous reputation.
No officer is going to get these men to fight!  They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress.
Unofficially, General Greene.
Colonel Reed...
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
No, please; an advance on your salary.
What is it, Marquis?
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
I feel the same, sir.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
That's right...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Martha... what?
To win this war I need an army.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Not today.
Colonel Washington?  Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia.
But, you do come from a military family?
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Where... do those men come from, George?
They can use their imaginations.
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
You hear that?
The land here is best for grain and corn.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What about him?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
He's around someplace.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
That's all there is to it, huh?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In just a second. Two...
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
C-18.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Or else what?
How'd you get in here?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
I'm looking at you.
You're not looking at me, Harry.
It's the kind of situation, you don't pay, you get your legs broken.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
Part of it, yeah.
You mean, Leo?
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
I had to tell 'em something.
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Really.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
You've been losing.
We call you a taxi.
The door from the patio, in back.
No, it was open. It wasn't locked.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I think it's not horrible.
That was Martin. He wants to have lunch tomorrow. That is, if you can make it.
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
Yeah?
I mean I could see myself in movies Robert De Niro had been in. Or I could maybe do an Al Pacino movie, play a hard-on. But I couldn't see myself in ones, like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby. They don't know how to take care of it and you see these big grown-up assholes acting cute -\96
Harry... My God...
You sure?
You okay?
You don't act like it?
Hello, Doris.
I miss Murray, Harry.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Yeah and I'm wondering, how did it go wrong? How did it all... slip away?
Oh, for Christ's sake \96-
Lufkin. His... agent.
But you are interested?
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
Let's not be too hasty.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Goddamit, Dodge.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Sounds like the hull.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
What?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
What's slow?
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Sudden flashes of light.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
What?
What'd you find up there?
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Why not call for help?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
He needs a doctor.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The same day she supposedly went down.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Greer to Murphy.
I must be in the wrong business.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Murphy, goddamit.
Morning.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Say what?
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Will you get off my back for once?
Are you still looking for a job?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
That guy rules!
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Hi Josh.
Nothing.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
Why not?
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Hi, Al!
You can have that one.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Hey - why do you have this?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
"Funky"?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
Just promise you'll do it.
Anthony's II!
That guy is totally amazing.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
That rules!
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
He gives me a total boner!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Why? What did he say?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Hi.
What about me? Am I not even here?
May I ask what you're doing?
How much is this?
Who does?
Hi... what's your name?
...are you waiting for a bus?
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Is this one any good?
Wow!
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oops! I dropped it!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
Every guy has a type!
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
It's not hopeless...
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
What, are you a klansman or something?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Aren't you going to get that?
Uh... hello?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
I-I'm sorry... uh so... uh... how --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
In what way do you mean?
What are you doing here?
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, sure. Of course.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What do you want?
Yeah, well... me neither...
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
What do we have here, Margaret?
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
You were contracted to work-
There is no reason for fear.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
No hints, Samuel.
I am a man of peace.
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Pleasant journey?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
What?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Very good indeed.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
What a good week.
Actually, no.
Samuel says you killed a lion.
...misfire... it jammed...
Think about something else.
Oh yes, I think so. 
For you.
Good news?
Thank you.  Why does he need you by him?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
You're also a human being, Frank.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Hello, Peter.
Men are very sensitive, you know.  We need to feel loved and desired, too.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
Or we could do that.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Is this the spot?
Sorry!
I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
Who are you going to call?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
Egon!
So far so good.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Is the line sinking?
Oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  I'm looking for an aerosol love potion I could spray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who, Ray?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
What's that?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  Let me know what you find out.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
Give it up, Ray.  You're living in the past. Ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  In a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
Tell him about the toaster.
And pure --
My people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  And there wasn't any Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome them, either.  What are you, Dana?
Is it a star?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Like a used car salesman.
You're quite a housekeeper.
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
He is the Destructor.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Did you see it?  What was it?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
I want you to have this. 
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Circle?
Nervous?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Yes?
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Something was definitely here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Don't cross the beams.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
Set entry grid.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Me, too.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
What is that... wailing?
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I am their hero!
Then you'd be out of a job.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Serious stuff...
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
He's very realistic.
This is our oil from our estates?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Who the hell are you?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Take your hands off me animal!
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer:  you take a fall.
You get to come alive again in the country!
How much money is involved?
Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.
Hello.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Is anything wrong?
Where we going?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
Did they ever find out?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
No -- don't cry --
I want to ask you a question.
I don't understand --
Let me go.
Don't tell me --
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
You won't?
We just can.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
Yes, I will.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
What did you do to her?
BENJAMIN?
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes sir?
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Is there an ashtray in here?
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Will you come in, please?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Aren't you?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No.
Yes?
What are you so scared of?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
Don't be nervous.
Do you understand what I said?
He didn't see me.
Did you get us a room?
Yes.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Will you bring me a hanger?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Thank you.
Are you afraid of me?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
What do you say to him?
We're talking.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What kind of car was it?
Really. I want to know.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Good.
I have my reasons.
No.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
How?
I don't believe you.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
No -- actually I'm not --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, no.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Say that again.
Sir?
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Hello.
I am not threatening you.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
You miss the point.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
The Carlsons' are here.
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
Have you a minute now?
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I've quit.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Like dancing?
Reducing?
What?
You live here?
Oh!
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Strange man...
Go away. Who are you --?
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
That's a silly joke.
I'll not denounce you.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Why later?
Bless you...
Till then.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
The Baron is tired?
What?
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Hello! Hello! --
Is that for me?
Any letters?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, I've got to find it.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
You like music?
Please -- please!
What's the matter?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Not too quickly.
How nice -- your daughters?
Miss Flaemm.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Of course -- of course. 
Insolent young cub!
I mean with the Manchester people?
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Sorry, Preysing. 
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Madam should sleep.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Last night?... There was no applause.
He will be on the train.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
You're discharged.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
Just one moment, sir.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What do you want with her?
Hi, Bobo.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
Permanent damage.
You want a drink?
You know it, Lilly.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Want a look?
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
Not much time.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
All right.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Don't mention it.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
No.
At what?
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
You want a drink?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you? You're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Well, uh...
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Where's the five?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Big spender.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
What?
I've heard the name.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Take a hike, you mean?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
Yeah?
You -- I don't know.
And hello to you, too.
What's that?
What?
Ate the gun. Oh.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Well, when you put it that way.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
I can be real stiff.
That's it?
Yes.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
No.  Wait for the police.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
Where are you going?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
Now you're joking, right?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
What are you doing here?!
You look kind of cold.
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Hey, you alright?
What are you looking at?
Wait.
Fuckin' A.
Ooooh, busted.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Let the party begin.
Beth, who's that guy that lives across the hall from you?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Mom -- Who is this?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mommy, I'm scared.
Mommy!!!
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
God, what's wrong with him?
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
No.
You know what gets me?
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
You know what gets me?
I'm liable to find anything!
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Me?
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Is Penelope in?
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
What an awful sound!
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
Fifty years?
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
For Africa.
Gee whiz--
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
You're my buddy.
Sir?
Life has denied me that thrill.
Dr. Woodly.  I should make a little list.
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
It makes life spicy.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
A hundred dollars!
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
Dad?
That's a rifle you have?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Eighteen--  and a half.
I'm engaged.
Not at all.
What's the matter?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Bluh.
We all are.
Harold!
Please--
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Now that's what I call fun.
Breakfast?
It couldn't!
Fish can't feel.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for my clothes.
I came for Paul as well.
A dozen?
Unless she has nerve.
Things.
He's a child!
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
No.
How do I load?
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
She's fine.  Please--
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
You've been bitten by bats?
You have chills?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
You're too modest.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Don't shoot.
No.  No.
Thank you--for my life.
What are you going to do?
It was a bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice is dead?
For what?
Who's dead?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
Don't touch me.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
A what kind of doctor?
That's an interesting piece of news.
I don't really know.
Are you and Dr. Woodly engaged?
What?
I don't get it.
Yeah.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
We don't have a maid any more.
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Please--
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
Possibly.
You were wonderful.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
This is very good for us.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.
You've got to fight from time to time.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
Kid--kid--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
No, I don't.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What do you mean?
You want a tip?
That's cool.
I'm getting angry.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Hello. You want some information?
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
It's your money. You talk.
Nah.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
You don't drink?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Is that the way it was with you?
Neither am I.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Granville?
What happened?
You are.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Mast?
In G.R.? Why?
I've got a meeting...
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
What happened, pilgrim?
What is it, Jake?
Hey man.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
Fifty cents admission.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
I thought you were a businessman.
Jake.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
Com'on, tell me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
To his own daughter?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Was he with a girl?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes.
Could I see your registration?
Isn't this your vehicle?
We planted it.
No.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Because if you are...
Edith was just telling me about her job.
Sorry I'm late.
What do you see?
Here's your shovel.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Do you sing and dance?
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
What's that?
Okay?
I think he's following us.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
But they'll put me in jail.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
- end where I began.
Yes.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
How do you do?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
Yes. It does.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
None at all?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Your classmates?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
That's right.
Yes.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Well, I didn't.
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Yes... Yes. You look...
She's done it.
I want to go back!
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
What?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I've got to finish it.
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Who?
They were over here, Professor.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
What the hell was that? An ape?
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
How does he know so much about me?
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
You're kidding --
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Myers?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
What was that??
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Are you sure about this?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Pardon?
You fucking ass-holes.
Want to buy a bed?
Will you sign for the bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
That your daughter?
Lucky man.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
No time for argument.
We've got such sights to show you --
Please. Get back into bed.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
You bastard --
You're Julia, right?
There is going to BE a wedding?
But you said --
No. God no.
What happened to you?
Back from where?
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
This is what began it.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You would be. They tore me apart.
You can't love him.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Don't you care?
Well we can't just stay here --
What happened?
This afternoon.
You're still blaming me.
No argument.
Julia?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Who was it?
Larry...
Oh baby.
Dead.
What are you drinking?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Is this your place ?
I suppose not.
Why don't you do the same?
What a pretty tune.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Great.
Take care, Dad.
Big house.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
I won't be able to stand.
What do we do if there isn't?
Meaning what?
Oh no?
Steve. Thank God you came.
'Bye.
Do I know you?
You gotta be kidding me.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Yeah.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Why would they care?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Hey.
My band.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Fuck off, Barry.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
The little skate-fuckers.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
He's got one!
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Yeah.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
I always hated this song.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
What needs sorting out?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye?  It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-- Alright, alright but --
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What were the others?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
You won't like it.
Is it better?
Of course it is.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Don't forget your CDs.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Who the fuck's Pig?
When are you going back?
Laura...
Let's go home.  Okay?
What it was like.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
What are you going to talk to me about?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Don't you like that?
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Hi, Mom.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
We're not there yet, Justin.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
You're very macabre.
Would you like more tea?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Someone beat you.
Who is he?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He was innocent.
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
What's all that?
You did kill those men.
It's some sort of party the town is throwing.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
You're using your son's name.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Yes.
He is older than I.
I haven't killed _you_.
But you're known so much. History I'll only read about.
Get out.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
I'm calling an attorney.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Aye.
You're not from these parts.
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
I did at that.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
Why does he want to kill me?
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Impotent cow.
It will take less effort as you learn.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
I doubt much can change that. The enemy has five brigades waiting for us.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
What is your position?
Equals?
Do not turn your back on me.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Are you sure?
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Where!
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
I knew his great-grandfather.
Long time.
What's the point?
I want you to come to me.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
The resemblance is amazing.
Morning Mr. North
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
But --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
Did you finish the interview?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Just for the first year.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, she'll know some day.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Call Duffy!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
You can't sell me that, Walter.
He's in the insurance business.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
Now you're talking!
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Hello -- hello...
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
How about Bruce's?
Hildy, darling!
It'll be Heaven!
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that reprieve!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
There's money in it, Cooley.
I don't know --
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Boy, did you see her go?
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
So have we!
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Goodbye, Yonson.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
He's harmless.
What went off?
Pure politics!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Got you, Williams!
Where's the old lady?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
There goes another scrub lady.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
You know it is!
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
How'd you get here, Earl?
What good'll it do?
What's that?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
Who? Me?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
Look out!
Get the cops, somebody.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Baldwin -- his name is.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
This is going too far, young man.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
Only till they get you into the local school.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You want to join our gang?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
You couldn't.
You're the biggest fibber.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Crocodiles! Aah!
What's that?
What is it?
Where?
And Jim.
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
What about it?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
And what's that?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
What is it, pet?
I don't believe this is happening to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Cone.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
What about the tree?
Which way?
How much further?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
What the hell are you laughing about?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
How long have you been running this place?
No, really.
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
No, no I think it's really interesting.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Yeah.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
What are you doing!
Is that all... think real hard.
How's about you give me those same directions.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Huh?
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Oh, yeah.
So what?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
What are you laughing at?
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun, but it's starting to get brutal.
I still don't.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Oh, I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
What should I do?
Get in... now!
Hey.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I guess not.
Wydell.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to...
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Shall we close up, then?
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
My little French.
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Please. I look a mess.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Loves animals. Loves you.
No. I married a midget.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Oh?
How'd you know where I was?
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Shaving cream?
Oh, and the sun block?
Come on.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
It's perfect!
Who is it?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Do you like my new look?
Really?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
I think he's ready.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
Puff, put the gun down.
Wait!
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
You bastard.
I'll make it up to you.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Will you take a check, Bert?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Hello, Eddie.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
What happened to you anyway?
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
What's the matter? What happened?
Well, we won't.
I'll beat him the next game.
Please don't get off me now.
Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Well... well, now.
It's quiet.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
With what?
Oh yeah? Where?
Just like that?
No, no more for me.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
When?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Long wait for a bus?
What time does the bus leave?
Have a nice trip?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
What do you do on the other days?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Where you been all day?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Oh, cut my finger.
No, why should I? It's yours.
What are you writing?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
Well, he owns things.
What is it, Eddie?
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Where's Bert?
Go on back to the hotel.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You name it.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
What about... now?
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
Mine.
You want me to stay?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Need some gas?
Bathroom?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
Is the hill ours too?
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I had an awful dream.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
What do you mean -- gone?  What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
Is that all he said?
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Why?
They'll get us.
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
Don't go in.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
George, where have you been?
Your father asked you a question.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
When?
I have school.
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
I don't know how you put up with him.
You saved a lot of lives.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
Spunky?
Dad, please...
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
We're loose!
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Is my wife in the air?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
Grey, you read me?
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
A meteor?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
Oh. Sorry.
That is an affirmative. I have victory dance. Mmmmmmm.
I don't need it.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Call them back.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.
See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
And before here?
Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Look what you did!
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
An old man's dream.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I usually don't either.
What's that?
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
It's important!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
You did!!
The floor's on fire! See?!
And the chair.
What?
This is intolerable!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Nice landing.
It's a new experience for me.
Dad?
Dad?!
The penitent man is humble before God.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Then we'll die.
This is your last chance.
Who?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Come one, what's wrong?
You will go to palace there.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
I like the service here.
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
You all right?
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
He's afraid of something.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
It's okay. You're all right now.
I want to go home...
Anymore ideas...?
I said something.
My name is AL.
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Are you threatening me?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
I know...it sounds insane.
Are you crazy?
Why he's argumentative?
You weren't listening!
Calm Down! Act rational.
You are CRAZY!
What do you mean we.
Which way do I go?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
I'll get in trouble.
It's just not enough.
Do you notice anything.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
I don't want to eat it.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Beautiful!
She doesn't seem to understand.
What do I do?
...Joe.
Where are you going?
Good thing I'm here to do the thinking.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Yeah. I did it.
But what's it look like?
What did that cost?
They both look good to me.
You're not just after this girl, are you?
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
I feel like an idiot.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
What is it?
It's embarrassing.
You shut down your sensors.
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Osaka.
Sapporo..
What are you doing?
Ow!
Aim just in front of his face.
Holy...
Dieter!
You're a lucky man.
Not that truth!
Sorry...
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You've cut your hair?
PEM115!
How about a deal?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
That crazy guy?
It is to me too.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Fine. You look fine.
Well...
We're here.
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Al?
Not...complaining, actually.
The fresh tuna?..
What did you say?
What?
...and sort of...disinterest.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
Who else is interested in me?
He didn't.
You're leaving.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
You don't believe me.
Then why are you smiling like that?
What?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What a mess.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Now what?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Yeah...I have to get away.
Excuse me?
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
Yes.
This the only spare?
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Where?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
P.J.'s.
When's your deadline?
Are you all right?
Shit...
I don't know what he was thinking.
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
What caliber is my gun?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
Use the bathroom.
Thank you, Bob.
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Yeah.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Area code 212-555-0199.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Alright?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
Lowell.
Yeah, that's right.
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Coffee?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
I know what I have to know.
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
Why?
I believe that? Yes, I believe that.
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
I told the truth!
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
Where are you, anyway?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
You threatening my family, now, too?
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Why in God's name would I want...?
What?
My God.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Who was that?
So who'd you hire?
You like kids.
I begged you to have a baby!
You're vulnerable.
These are yours.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
She never particularly cared for me.
No.
Honey, I could sit...
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Hi.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
You were going to have this thug...?
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Who's that?
Is this a lover?
Do you know him?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Herb wants to see me?
Mr. Massey --
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
That's delusional.
...arty farty!
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
Nothing?
Wait... He wants to give her...?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She owes me a meal.
Extinguish?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Who said anything about a reward!
We'll go into that some other time.
That's an evasion.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Oh, come now\97
Ridiculous!
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
If you really mean it, I will.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had on\97she can raise some money on that?
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me\97and maybe we'll be friends\97  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Don't want to talk to\97don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
No.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Take my advice\97grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
Nope. No complaints.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Detectives!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough\97we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Aren't you afraid of me?
You're crazy.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation\97a warm heart\97and a loving nature.
What's got into you?
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
You think it's simple, huh?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement\97  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
You! Don't make me laugh.
What about money?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Better go back to your bed.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited\97
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus\97I told them to wait!
In about fifteen minutes.
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the\97
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff\97much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Oh, by the way\97what's your name?
The old man's screwy!
The dame's too smart for him.
Up yonder. See the lights?
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
A trumpet?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
What's up?
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
Five G's\97or I crab the works.
Yeah\97the "big boy"\97the Boss of the outfit.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Street cats?
What was his voice like?
So you saw Oswald how many times?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
That's fine, Numa, but what about all the people who aren't writing letters.  They're sitting home reading all these lies.  I just heard NBC crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - not on the Kennedy killing, but on us.  One of their top guys, Harry Stoner, is talking to everybody he can find about you, boss...
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
What's it look like, Nick?
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
You still questioning any Cubans?
...give me protection?
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Why?  What's wrong?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that was in Dallas, or was it an impersonator.
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' rug today.  You know, at one time I even had a full head of hair like everyone else.  And then I lost that. That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the bastard.  All I got left is in his rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the newspapers - I know it.  That's how the Agency works.  They use people, chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now it's my turn.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
They killed him, honey.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Some people would say you're paranoid.
Jim Garrison?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
How much more?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
HOLD IT, CHIEF...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
How many men are working with you on this?
Do you walk home?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
How old is that machine gun shit?
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
And you didn't tell the Police?
What's she want?
I doubt it.  Who's your friend?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I gave you my card there.
Is it dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
What did they want to know?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
What'dya think?
You get a chance to use it?
Want to hear some music?
This is pretty.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
How do you get it out?
How'd you feel about it?
It's different with men.
Well, hello.
Catching a movie.
"American President"
Why?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
You know some interesting people.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
What do you do when he comes home?
It'll be more than that.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
I didn't use you, Max.
We're partners.
Wanna go?
What if I plead guilty?
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
I know what it looks like.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
What for?
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I thought I did.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Sure.
How long you been with Ordell?
What were you two fighting about?
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You already knew that?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
Jackie?
It looks good on you.
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
This fella Beaumont, they say what happened to him?
What the hell you doin'?
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
How the fuck they know that?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
It's boring, isn't it?
Want a hit?
What for?
Is it ready to go?
You okay?
Want a Metrix?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
You're fourteen years old here?
Were you a disco girl?
Where were you?
C'mon, don't lie.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Please.
Lemme have the bag.
I'm carrying it.
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Guess where I am?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Well, you the one in motherfuckin' charge.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
How long was she in there?
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
I'm going out for a few hours.
That's Winston. He works here.
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Ten thousand sounds high.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
I need your name and address.
House or apartment?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
You know who this is?
I'm alone.
That's all?
How'd you find me?
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
Well, give it to me then.
She was afraid.
She's all alone.
It's the next street.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Get me out of here.
I'm alive.
Remember?
What do you want?
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Short? It's ended.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Daddy, what was that noise?
Wait ... Daddy.
Don't go.
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I am.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I can't relax.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
I had this weird flash just then.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
I'm not cold.
It's not healthy with it closed.
I moved the couch. That's all.
What do you think?
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
And look what I got.
I must have been out of my head.
Wait. Don't.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
We're at Della's.
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
I can't do it.
We're all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I can waitress. I'm good.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Where have they gone?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
I can't move.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
He'll never make it.
Push 'em back.
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?
I'm sorry.
Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
I just need to talk.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
He's not part of the program.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What's that?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Minimal.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Better let me.
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say this is bad news.
Where is...?
Get them in the lab!
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
What the hell are you doing?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Sergeant!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Where are you going?
We're screwed!
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
You okay?!
Now what?
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Kaboom.
Close the fucking door!
And what's with the headgear?
I'm missing two!
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Robot huh?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Kay-em you okay?
I missed you too.
Leave him behind!
How do you know?
I gotta go back.
I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Azrael can you repeat that?
You're not going anywhere.
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
Yes!
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
This is Matt Hooper...
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
What's that one, there?
That's it! Radio in for help!
Probably out in the back yard.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Don't forget these.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland.
He lost it on the way up.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
Got a pen on you?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
How can you tell?
He ate a car?
Where'd you get all this?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
Wait a minute! I need you.
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
What day is this?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Look at him take it!
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Over there!
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Follow him!
What can that gun of yours do?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
So, what do you think we should do?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
What's up?
Really? What are they like?
Jesus, Bleek.
We could get back together too.
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
I still have your virginity!
You know it's okay.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Cool it.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Why aren't you at work?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
We definitely want it to have junk.
What is it?
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
What?
You do?
Oh, okay. Like this.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
No.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Then what's going on?
Is the baby okay?
No...
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Yeah, like people in love.
Please stop now.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Touche.
No way! She's pretty.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
You guys are playing music?
She answered our prayers.
Have you found a place to stay?
Hi, I'm Adele.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
What?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
What's this?
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
You took this picture?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
What if they're dangerous?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Early, what're you doin'?
...I don't know.
What's wrong with her?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Sure.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
The warehouse. I'm not that drunk.
I like that.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
Carrie.
All set?
What's that?
There's more...
Carrie, watch for Early.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
You were plenty hot.
...You know what I mean?
What happened?
His Parole Officer.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Well, how was it?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Shut up.
How much you gonna take?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Sup then? Sup?
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
I'm nervous.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Why?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Come dance.
Telly is at Steven's?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
I'm sorry.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Miss, would I be prying?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Like where are your erogenous zones?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yep.
And you don't get shit out of it.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Not too late.
Hello?
So, how many people live here now?
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Casual.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
The message!  I figured out--
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
You think he's dirty?
No shit!
What is it?
A few people.
What do you mean, stand out?
We'll find the evidence.
Just like who?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
How?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
No problem.  We're in.
Nope.  Nothing.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Come here.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
Is your dad here?
Do you like my dad?
I know he really likes you.
Anything?
How long she been dead?
What do you think he did?
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
We can't rely on your judgement anymore.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
We got a problem?
Peter...
About what?
Bainbridge Books.
That's a very personal question.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
It wasn't intentional.
I'm just curious.
You mean like in the steam room?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know you didn't
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
I'm not playing a game now.
You.
Exactly.  It's the key.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Lyssa ...
Colwyn ...
In the Arctic ice.
The new Queen lives.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
You have not slept in two days.
Never.
He ran a great risk, helping us today. If he opposes his fate, his death will be terribly painful.
They can be saddled.
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
Quell?
Sugarballs?
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
My spells always go wrong when I am observed. Be gone!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
The new King.
It is the time.
Can you see?
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Look.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
She bore you many children?
You had a son.
You see?
Knowledge.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
It will not help.
You will come with me.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
...No...
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Yes?
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
...Composer.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Salute.
It's impossible.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
The normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  This is called, "Claudication,"  As a result, there isn't enough circulation to your body.  That accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I'm sure you've encountered.
Yes -- you are.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
It's a special day isn't it?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
No.
Walk with me?
I thought we both wanted the same things.
To where?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Red flags man.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Well, hello.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Each inch represents 150 miles...
This story is big huh?
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
When are you leaving?
I'm walking there Kris.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Tom Joad?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Good morning.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
I guess I do too.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
If I was I'm sorry.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Sera...
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Your color.
Please!
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
About ready for another drink?
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Harvard Law School?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I loved him!
I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours!
What's going on?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Where you got in the shower.
Come again?
Why the hell not?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, but --
So everything you just said --
Was she carrying a weapon?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
What's going on?
Yes?
Yes?
I think so...
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
You can't go home!
Uh -- family.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
You have Stromwell.
Okay, if Brooke didn't kill the guy, who did?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Aside from that.
But maybe it's not what you think.
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
So?
I can't.
Projecting joy is not my job.
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Whoa -- Why?
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
Class schedule, map, book list.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
You got into Harvard Law?
So -- uh -- how was your first class?
You look -- nice.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Thanks for the backup.
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
Why so few?
You go?  Not watch fun?
We come watch... we come watch...
You go to lady now?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
No more... please...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
You're a beast!
What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Are we here?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
This is ogre's magic.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
Wait, Jack.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
What magic have we on our side?
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
How're these?
You promised!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
A promise is a sacred oath.
What shall we do?
Where are you going?
They tricked you.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Tis not fit for a princess.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Honored to make your acquaintance.
What's this now?
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
How do I get the horn back?
This is not the time for squabbling.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
In every way.
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Where?
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
How came you by this blade?
Lost?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Dad's disappeared!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
And video games after!
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
What's that for?
Red.
Are you his friend?
Alyssa.
What's today?
You have to ask like that?
My mother would die.
Huh?
Really?
I'm coming in.
Why are you so uptight?
What's the point of this?
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
He's at work while I'm here.
He won't leave my room.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Maybe...?
Forty.
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
I've got one favor to ask.
Thanks for the shower.
Is Alyssa here?
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
Are you totally insane?!
I'm leaving.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I know the feeling.
I know parts of who you are.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I loved him too much.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
Ah!  Oh....
It's okay.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
I love those doors.
When's school over?
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
It makes me sad.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
You head was pressed against my chest.  I could feel your heart racing.  And I remember I kissed your hair.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
It's been a while.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
It sounded like a pick-up line.
Let's not do this, okay?
Is your back still killing you?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I could die.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck?
Then you tell me, what just happened?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
After the kids are back in school.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You never really trusted me.
That's the problem.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
The door was open.
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
She's doing just fine.
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
These are free papers.
It's 1945. It's a different world now.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
She's alright, isn't she?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Want me to come back some other time?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
You know I trust you, Claude.
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
That's some long green.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
This fork is filthy.
No, man. I want you to have it.
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
It's too late for plans.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
What do you think about that?
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Where'd you get this?
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
ADRIAN!
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
That's what I thought!
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Hello, Cassius.
No!
I'll call her later.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
What is it?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Makin' friends already.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You came through, Nicky.
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
You sure you're down with this?
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Good idea... kill me.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
Yes. What is rent?
Why is that funny?
That just hurt a lot.
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Answer the question!
How do you want us?
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Why did you do that??!!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
What's your name?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
And?
I'm listening.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't..
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
I -- I can't.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
What's that?
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I have never seen a face like that before. It must be the look of great age. Whoever he was he was terribly old.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
What does that water do?
Is it inside the city?
Come with us.
Hello, Sandman.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Are there any other humans?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
Well? How do you like it?
Sure, what's wrong with that?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
What's happenin'?
I'm, okay... You okay?
You're a musician?
Do you own a video camera?
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
You recognize that guy?
Hello.
I don't know.
How'd it happen, Alice?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
You got him.
You killed him.
Better.
The police called us.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Yeah, Mack?
I want to see him.
Do you remember?
What's the matter?
What is this, Rogoff?
I won't ever tailgate.
There's no other bedroom?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
What is it?
Where's Alice?
What's that?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Don't you want to watch it?
We've got to call the police.
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
At sixty?
You like pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Suit yourself, champ.
How ya doin', Pete?
No. No, I don't.
You want some company?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Last time I saw you.
I don't know.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Two years!?
Fossils, huh?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Yes.
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Hey, what's happened to you?
Cave, eh? Where?
Right this very minute!  The porters are waiting for us on the plateau. And that Chinaman thought he could stop me. Come along.
You mean you don't want to go?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Where is your mad pilot?
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
Oh, yes.
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
When was all this?
He amputated his own leg?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Charming, isn't she?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
What do you want?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Sondra Bizet.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Uh-huh.
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
What about the porters?
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
Now that dinner is over, if you'll excuse us, we're very anxious to discuss ways and means of getting back home.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Thank you.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
You think we're nuts.
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
We'll take it from here.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
Well, one thing's for sure.  You could certainly lighten up.
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Jesus...
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
Since how long?
We saw it in the office.  It went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
After I got the shit beat out of me!
You coulda told me what you were doing.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What do we do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Nowhere.
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I just wanted to scare em.  So I go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if I really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
This it?
Which way?
Kay?  What's your 20?
They're gone.
And they're buying it?
How'd you know?
Wally!
What?
What?
Agatha --
No.  Follow him.
Oh, God...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Please, I want to go back...
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
You set your patients on fire!
You the sentry?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Chief, the investigator from the Fed is here.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
The mall?
Go ahead.
What?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
You're certain?
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
She spoke to me.
Are these all of her previsions?
Just go to the beginning!
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Sean, wait...
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
Look, I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Heal who?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
What?
Why?
I believe in that system...
What safe place is that?
Where?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
John?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
I understand.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Precog Deja Vu...
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
What kind of cop were you before this?
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
He looks familiar.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Howard --
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any sugar either.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
Since right after we lost our son.
What was it then?
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
What, sir?
Is he cute?
He's great, right. Is he great?
What the fuck was that about?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I don't know.
Can you take me to Color Me Mine?
Honey?
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Take her.
What's your record at?
He making the drop?
How bad is it?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where we going?
How so?
That it?
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
A million. Easy.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what I got to say?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yes.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
There won't be a next thing.
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
I can wait around if you want.
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Can you check?
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I think we might.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I gotta pick up the baby.
Why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
What? Did she say something?
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
How much is it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
They didn't say an address?
How'd they know who you were?
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You know this guy?
Yeah. What vibe?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Put that shit out...
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Let's do it.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
No.
I'm sorry...
So what do we do?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Dude, we were practically made...
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yes?
Excuse me.
Where's Spa.
It means you got a gun?
Don't drag my ass into this --
I'm half Irish.
And where is...?
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yes. You're going to New York.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
Yeah.
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
Keeps me out of the army.
Is your papa West Indian?
When?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
Little.
I will do it.
I can't.
I can't.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Make it plain.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
It won't be easy.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Talk about what?
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Get some sleep.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
And like a fool I believe it.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Get out.
Another one?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
Where do I find you?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Reina Rosas.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Don't lie to me.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
I'm here.
Yeah, right...
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
You mean a misfire?
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Potential? I don't understand.
So you were unhappy?
Do you think he'll come back?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
Could I ask you a question?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You think too much?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
Sorry.
Rosanna Guerrero.
For an American she understands this country very well.
[You have the money.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
Good news. You're going back to school.
Yes, mom?
I like him, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Ufa!
What they say?
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
Marty...
No...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
What?
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Well...
On accounta...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Tommy!
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Y'all mind the store.
You \96 must \96 open \96 me \96 up \96 again?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore \96  House. You in the market Duke?
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
I have a tent to myself.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Frank...
Wait a second...
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
And there it is.
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
For you, Trapper.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
What's going on? Who started this?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Sir?
Can you make out what they're talking about?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
Never mind.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter\97and stick by it?
Huh?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Who?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
How much money do you get?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er\97  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Hello?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
The letter from John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Well, maybe you're right.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
What's the idea?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Now listen, Ann\97he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Colonel!
Have you seen him?
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
What do they want?
Yeah, Boss?
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Ba-ll!
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
You don't have to\97Why, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
That man is gonna be on that roof. Don't ask me how I know. I just know. And you know it as well as I do.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I don't get it.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and\97
Is there anything wrong?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started\97
She isn't?
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Pretty good?  Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
I know one way you can do it.
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No -- you can't do that.
Dinner's on you.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I hate fucking Springfield.
Are you in charge, Roper?
For now that's all.
Open your shirt.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
How did you like Toronto?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
Tell me what you need.
I can't do that.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You tell me.
You know why I like the track?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I'm just practicing my lying.
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
What the fuck is going on.
You're crazy.
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I worship you.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
You think I didn't need you?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
There is?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Scottie, Scottie...
Scottie?
Roper.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
What do you want?
What do you need?
Why --
Do you believe in miracles?
It's time to wake up.
You are not a God.
Dream?!
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
What?
The woman you're stuck on.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
What did he tell you?
An interface attendant.
Insurance?
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
And it meant something.
I wasn't with you.
Why not?
Program name?
Access granted.  Male or female?
We've got him locked!
He's on us!!
Wow.  Sand.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
PTERODACTYL!
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NEW POWER COINS!!
Two thirty three a.m.
I'm in!
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
SKULL!!
Just shut your gap!
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
You own a hotel, sir?
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
The goddamned bastards.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Up here, Boss.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Shane was a friend of yours?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
You here with Bobby?
Something came up.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
I booked passage to London.
Would it be painful for you?
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
Like Don Maranzano.
I'll handle the Boss.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
You get fifteen percent.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yes?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Monkeybone?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
You're really gonna pop the question?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Sure. Why?
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
I might wake up.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Where'd he go??
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Huh?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
Did you like the first act?
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Drunks are funny--
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Okay. You don't mind?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
All right, why?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
He's batty!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Where were you?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Y-yes.
Ah, now, that's better.
Mr. President! A point of order!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Fine--
Just fine.
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
Can't you?
*No*!
What's your name?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Good. Where are we?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
I did--and--and I got right up.
On paper?
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Letitia.
I--I don't know how I got it out. My heart was right up here all the time--  I wonder what Senator Paine thought of it?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well, I guess it's a chance.
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Chick--
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
You want to see me, Senator?
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
And if he can raise public opinion against us--if any *part* of this sticks--
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Pixilated.
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
And you saw them happen?
Oh, thank you!
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Well, here we are again.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Hello, Mary?
Huh?
Look, I can do it!
How'd you get the picture?
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Yes, but you said\97
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Sit over there, will you?
How is this, sir?
He's not home, I tell you!
Come on, John. What happened?
Relatives of old man Semple.
Must we have the echo?
Newspaperman?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I can't find him.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
You're going to New York with us.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Why not? Who is he?
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Have a drink?
That's funny. Why is that?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Why, it's an artistic institution\97
Naturally.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
\97my wife wanted me to tell you she\97  \97she prays for you every night.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Please, Mr. Cedar!  Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
What do you think you're doing?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
But she's on the telephone\97
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I have eighteen more minutes!
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
No?
Where's your wife, Henry?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
I was... never satisfied.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
I feel like we're making real progress here.
It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
What brought this on?
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
What?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
What it might take is... doing time.
Maybe some of us don't need this crap!
Hello, Lionel.
It's a country club. Don't worry about it.
But you know how to drive?
Do you think that's a good idea?
Ph.D., psychologist.
I think you know what I mean.
Well, look who's here...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
What can you tell me about this?
No.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Mom's such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
So whose route is this?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Is it something you've heard about me?
...How violated I feel?
You feel violated?
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
In maybe three or four issues.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Would you like another beer?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Who else knows?
"Get to know your therapist."
And a birth certificate is enough?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
If he arrives before us, it will be too late.
Let's make us even, shall we?
Goin' somewhere?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
You lie.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
You two!
Is he supposed to look like that?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Got it!
Got guts, lady.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You're welcome to my share of the spider webs.
None taken.
You did not!?... We're not!?
We gotta get her back.
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
Where are you going?
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
Atta, girl!
Hey, do I look like a Man?
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
Yes!
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Have you considered my offer?
They always call the great ones nuts.
I'd better go.
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Hi.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Bye. 
Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Oh don't start that again --
What are you talking about?
You sure that's how you spell it?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
Maybe there was traffic.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
You did?
And there's the Sphinx.
To us!
It's time.
We've got lift off!
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
I'm glad you like it.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
There are none here.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
And where is the army?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
When did it start?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
Oh...?
Thank you.
Good evening, sir.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
What's your name?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
May I offer you a drink?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Promise me.
Yes!!
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Come in.
Come in.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Y'all never use it?
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
No I'm not.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
What's the green stuff poking out?
I ain't trying to rob you...
Nobody!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
Damn, you got a stalker.
So.
I walked.
How can they do this?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Yeah, air.
You go first.
What you see?
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I will.  When can I come visit?
You want us to give you a ride?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I did.  Is that door locked?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You see that?
What it say?
Roach, what are you doing?
I say we go over there and kick their asses.  I can take the little one.
Roach...Roach, come on.
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Get 'em, Craig!
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Ah damn.  Damn.
What the fuck you looking at?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
You too big.
Hey, how you get out of here.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
My back.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Don't remind me.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Amtrack?
Where'd you come from?
I have a problem.
You shot her?
Who did?
What?
There's only one way to find out for sure. Try to cancel the last speech.
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
You're out of your mind.
I will do no such thing.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What about the gun?
How should I...?
You killed him.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
No.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
I think you better put that away.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Will you promise me that?
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Who?
Keep the change.
Irene is going to help.
Fuckin' A.
Hey!
Close your eyes.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
That one.
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
Yeah.
What do you figure he done with it?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
No, Ben.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Just went?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He lied!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
You go set down by the River.
Amen! Amen!
Hing, hang, hung.
Tell me a story, John.
Pearl! You ain't --
If we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
I'll see to Pearl.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
What are you doing, boy?
What's taking you so long about it?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
All right boy: where's the money?
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
John's bad.
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
He never asked me for nothin'.
Miz Cooper!
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
What the hell's going on!?
You okay?
You believe in anything?
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
What happens if they don't do that?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
DAD! GET US OUTTA HERE!
Maybe god's punishing us all...
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Get into bed.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
Go even crazier?
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
I never touched her.
No.
What you mean 'all at once'?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
You feel better now, right?
No more fights?
Aren't you late?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
And you too, Ninotchka.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
What is it, Anna?
No, that's not him...
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Misha! Misha!
We had to take it on account of the safe.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
What a lovely room you have here.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Which lawyer?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
Your Highness...
Is this satisfactory?
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Let's do that.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
Comrade Buljanoff...
A week?
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
What's new?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
You want me to go in there?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Thank you.
And where are we?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
I will start with you.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Let's forget that we ever met.
As a representative of Moscow...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
I didn't follow you.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
I have never heard one.
Not funny, huh?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
You see? Life can be so simple.
No... go on.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Thursday.
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Are we going to build our little house?
No music.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Hello, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Make it ice cold.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Yes, Swana, you did.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
All right, I'll listen.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Here, please...
Good morning, Comrade.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
We could check the tape again, sir.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Executive clemency ...
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's leaking.  He's the one ...
It's a code or something.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
I like it.  I like the idea.
We can't touch Hoover --
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
Sir, the deadline is today.
That was civil war.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
I did?
But what are we paying him for?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
Because they're not Americans.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
I can't ...
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
Not if I give you all the cards ...
Are you tapping Kissinger?
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
He was a politician.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
We can prosecute the New York Times, go for an injunction ...
And Dick beat the shit out of them.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
You all right?
Get off that.  That leads nowhere. You should offer condolences to the families of those kids.
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
Bernstein.
Of them.
It makes us human ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
Dick, don't...
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Anything.
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
Congratulations, Dick.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
Hiding what?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Why didn't you?
It'll be over soon.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Some say you are, Rocky.
Want a cup?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Yes.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Carla Jean...
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
What about yours?
...I believe they've done lit a shuck.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Wasn't no bullet?
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
...This month's checks.
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
Don't hurt no one.
...How'd you sleep?
I got it Mama.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
What's in the satchel?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Did you buy that gun?
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
What's that.
Where does he work?
Hello?
What's this about?
...I know where you are.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...Me?
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
Is somethin' wrong?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Well... I need to close now --
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Yes.
What kind of tent?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
November the 28th, last year.
Yessir.
Well enough.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
The heroin. You don't have it.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Are you jackin' with me?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Sheriff, I don't...
You should get the order you want.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...plenty
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
Bad idea...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You're lying!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Well, do something, then, damnit!
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
Do you know who I am?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
George...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...like the water purifiers?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
What're you doing here, Roy?
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
How did you know?
Dr. David Ravell.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
What are those for?
Were you with him this whole time?
Does he know you think he's real?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Rosa...
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
The fuck you talking about?
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Joyce was screwing Del.
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
What?
That was a really shitty thing to do.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
I'm not telling.
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
I see.  May I?
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
Because it ain't natural, young man.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
What do you think my father would do if I told him I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Yeah?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Hang on there -
It ain't the law!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Izzat right?
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Suckin' away.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Helluva idea.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
That's not my ring.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
A million dollars.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
It was a moment a weakness!
It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
It was a powerful air.
...Yeah?
Mama said you was hit by a train!
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hi, Byron.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
What's your name, boy?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
I want to fly, sir!
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
What did you call me?
What did you call me, boy?
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Something tells me you've been here before.
You're sure it's okay?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
What other issue is there, Sid?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
That was you guys, huh?
Lynette, where's Sid?
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
Do you know that for sure?
What?
What if she called the cops?
Th --
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
Where did you get this clown?
Open it.
Can we come in?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Master bath.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
A what?
Watch your mouth.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
478...
What's going on?!
Can't hear a thing.
YOU HAVE TO!
We're never getting out of here.
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Why?
Well... is it loaded?
What's up?
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
...Glad you came man.
Rodgers... this is no good...
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yes sir I was.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Did you shoot the officers in question?
We're working on that...
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Huey man I got to talk with you...
Tell that to the pigs. Better yet tell that to Malcolm.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
I do. You think you're smart enough to keep playing the game?
What's the pig's name?
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
I saw... but...
Motherfuckers...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
You believe that?
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
You're surrendering.
You are familiar with how these things are done.  In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
How can we end this madness?
What news?
And the Governor?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
How old are you?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
You were an Englishman then...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Not yet, Thomas.
Put those away.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
It's gorgeous!
Please hurry.
Yes.
No-I guess not.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
What's up, sugar?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I'm not tired!
Then why do I have to go to bed?
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
What?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
I can hardly read these.
No need to apologize.
Yes, but--
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
What are those for?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
Can I have another one?
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Leave me alone!
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
I think it's rather extraordinary.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
Well, honey...you know that...
Thank you, Louis.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
You're in league with Barbossa!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
That was before I met one, of course.
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
How did you get off the island?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Move away.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
I can get you out of here.
Agreed.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
What's that?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Look, I don't mean to rain on everyone's ascension here, but we got a little problem.
Wheelchair accessible.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
How apropos.
Like rotting meat.
Oh no?  Smell this.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Do you think she loves him?
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Hey!
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Well, you got another problem.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.
I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
... just like the mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Just look at it!
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
What's that?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Argon's private lab.
What in the...?
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Daniel, just forget Argon.  Let's get out of here.  We'll find another way to stop the waste.
God, what a fight that was.
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I could have you fired right now.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Exactly.
Don't mind Mother.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
May I use your telephone?
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh, Mother!
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house\97
You have the cutest nose I've\97
I know that.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Anne, come here. Listen\97
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves\97
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I\97
Oh hello, Anne\96 He types furiously.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
That's an excellent idea.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Come on, get going, get going!
Not on my own beat, no.
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
Araby?
Who are you?
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Did you take anything out of those pants?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
There you are\97!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
How far have you gotten?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Did who?
What do you know about Conrad?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Here you are.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
What other girl\97?
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
Thanks. May I sit down?
We just thought that\97
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand\97and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Nobody seems to want to do anything\97  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Heavens! The man's insane!
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Does it look okay?
Thank you.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Sure you are.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh.  I can't.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Dan! Arrest them!
What's outside of Pleasantville?
Mr. Simpson ...
Lemme see that.
I still don't see why we're doing this.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Who's that?
Jen, listen ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Not directly anyhow ...
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Hi.
Mmmmgh.
So what's it like?
What's that like?
What's going on?
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
BUD.
What do you mean?
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
What's wrong?
Do you have the lettuce?
Have you cooked the burgers?
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
Well don't you?
Oh, hi.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
Yes, I'll be there.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
It's not cool?
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
Tell me why.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hi. This is Jack.
No.
Where are you?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Yes.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
It was cool last night.
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you know them.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
What do you do with all this pudding?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
I don't know.
I don't freak out very often.
Hello?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Where do you have to go?
Ok.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Ok.
Yeah.
I cut myself.
The police are on their way.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
You want her to call you Jack?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I'll say whatever I want --
Sorry about that.
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
It's alright.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
You ok?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Yes. Sorry.
Ok.
I know.
I know.
Your expenses are your own.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
Hello?
Put him through.
It's not bad, it's ok.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Madeleine --
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
NEVER!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Well?
I'll do everything in my power --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
I'll pass the word on, then.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
It's a long story, this one.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
...yes, I've got that bit...
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Doesn't that please you?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Sure you can, just--
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Oh, why is that?
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
There. That's right.
This picture--
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
He lied to me
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Not for me.
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Fuck you
It doesn't have to be
I'll hire you  -- right now-
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
Craig is one syllable
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
You gonna watch?
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
It came.
You're going to destroy it
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
For the title
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Let's go, Jake, wake up!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What who's been sayin'?
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Do you see her yet?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Nah, she would never...
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Nine o'clock.
Yeah. At night.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Jake...
I like the gym smell.
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
But, Jake, I was just...
Huh?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
What's the matter with you?
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
The kids are sleeping.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
This is Doyle's house.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Name me a better photographer.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
His wife took a trip.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jewelry?
But I'm not a killer!
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
Jefferies.
Wrong day?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I'll send you some comic books.
Jeff --
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
What about this morning? Any developments?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
What are you two talking about?
Yes.
Who's Thorwald?
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
What a day I've had!
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
What is it you're looking for?
Maybe she died.
No comment.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
I wonder where he's going now?
What doesn't?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
What for?
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Steady Marlon!
Friend of yours?
You know something?
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.  We're going to bring him down.
What time is it?
You can't protect me.
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Come back tomorrow.
Hi.
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
What?
Isn't he schizoid?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
Who's that?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
What?
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Do I have to spell it out?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
See?
It doesn't matter to them.
You can trust me, Judy.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Ever been in a place like this before?
How many rooms do you think there are?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Plato, where's your father now?
Do you think your father means that?
You weren't looking for company, were you?
Didn't you forget something?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
I guess I just don't understand anything.
Why?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
A man of some travels.
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
-- till he fucked his parole --
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
NO!
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Nick died for me....
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick, what happened --
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
What?
No --
You... you don't know me --
Put him in the truck.
You knew the place --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
We walked the place for a week.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Do I get a country-western name?
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Where the HELL did he go?
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
...so where is he?
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
Having romance problems, Romeo?
Three days, man.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Rudy, don't move --
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
Start talkin
That's what it looks like!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
How ya doin', Toothpick?
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
We can work this out, can't we?
I don't know, but somebody did.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
But what is this?
Jesus Christ!
Who's your parole officer?
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Mr. Blue's dead?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
What for?
What the fuck are you talking about?
What're you talkin' about?
Why?
For what, the cops?
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What's wrong with it?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
I told ya he'd be pissed.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Who shot who?
What's the matter with her?
This must have been in the family a long time.
Our kind of women?
And this is Helen Carter.
So am I.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
There's a nice boy.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
So that was why she tried to run away.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
Who's Lednov?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You know what she asked me?
Is that the only reason you came back?
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
And you're all alone.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
I said let's go.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Gee, I can't.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
And that's tough, isn't it?
How about California?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
She was only teasin'.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Goodnight.
Are you okay?
Me, too. 101?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
It's coming!
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Maybe we can study together or something.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Hi Buddy.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Feel that?
Listen to me I --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
How about these buns?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
It was you...
Both of them?
This can't be happening?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
What the hell are you doing?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Huh?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
Good idea, and don't forget to give her a good-night kiss.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Would you please focus?
My God! Is she dead?
What the hell?!
Hello Dwight.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
Alright... I might need your help.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
I'm so glad you're here.
It's okay. I understand.
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
I woke up naked, too.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
"Fucked me."
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Oh, boy! 
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Bring her home... I guess.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I love that you're my wife.
You bring me such peace...
Shhhh..
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
He killed people, Mom.
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Murder, honey.
You know who I am, August?
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
I don't like this.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
This is about another murder \97\97 a woman at Fifty Second Street
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
The people at the restaurant?
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
What's that?
Let her know what?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
You'll be all right?
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
If it is true \97 there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Not I \97- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -\97 "My courage like a white plume" \97 and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Wait \97- there is that other favor.
Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish \97 to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice \97\97 that's it, isn't it?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I'll be out in a minute.
But she was here?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
That was quick.
Oh, uh-huh.
Why'd you drop out?
I don't know.
Would you mind?
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
Why is that?
What?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
You know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
Yes.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Is he going to see this?
Did you have sex before you were married?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
I guess not.
No.
So you do fantasize?
About me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
You're really never going to make love again?
If you were in love with me, would you?
But if you were?
But that was part of it?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Why?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
You son of a bitch!!
Ann, do you see a pattern here?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
What do you mean, like physically?
What brought this on?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I hate my sister.
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
What?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
And what?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Questions about sex.
I wanted him to see me.
He wouldn't do that.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
I feel like I do.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Here it is.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Do I know you?
I just want to know why you're here.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Doing what?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How do we start?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Your first sexual experience.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I've got to get back to the office.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Hello.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Why not?
Who?
Student?
Everybody has a past.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
No.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
Mr. Millaney?
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Medical clinic?
Anything wrong?
But where are you going?
You say something?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
What happened?
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
So who changes?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
I don't get it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
How's Brad?
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
When do I get to see Brad?
SIN-I-FUL
How did you come by this scenario?
Why Janet?
A free thinker.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!

Could I do that later?

And none of them worked?
Isn't she lovely?
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
Why are you being so defensive?
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
Bye.
How's the trip?
Hey, Miles. Long time no see.
You got it.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Two years ago, buddy.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Are you a writer too?
Anything I'd know?
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Are you chewing gum?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Nice, huh?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She what?  When?
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Get the trunk.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Does she know about Saturday?
Besides what?
What?
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
What do you think's going on?
What is it?
I said okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
So what's the plan?
Me?
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
You broke some.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
You want to join us?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Are you all right?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
So what's your novel about?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
Yeah? Like what?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Hello?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
French or American?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Stephanie! Stop!
You talked to Wendy?
Houdini's sick.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
There's dust in it.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I don't want you to die.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
You do?
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry, what book is this?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
These are D's; I need double A's.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Dad.
What's that?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Don't do it!
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
Emmett.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Maybe we'll see you sometime.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
Goodbye?
Are you all right?
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Hobart, what are you people doing here?
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
I gotta be going.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
I'll see you around.
Where is Rae?
That's a lie.
Never will again.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Where's your brother?
What are you talking about?
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
He was murdered.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why him?
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
You got a place to stay?
What brings you into my saloon?
I took out thirteen dollars.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Where's the dog now?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
-- What's wrong with that?
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Why isn't she with you?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
My two favorite girls.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
I just read somewhere --
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Hello?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Thank Simone for the tickets.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
You're with me to be close to her?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
Is she here?
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You have to see her.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I love you, Lainey.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
I know what you're up to.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Is it a jamming device?
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Thank you.  It's not important.
Would you like me to read?
Is Miss Simone coming today?
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Simone.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I forgot your name.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You want to ask me a question?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
Yes.
No.
What makes you think that?
...No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Cats?
Yes?
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
You really look better.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I wish I were somewhere else.
A lady. She died.
What are you thinking, Momma?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Witch.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
Carl, what are you doing?
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Ow!
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What about Jeremiah?
Getting ready.
You wouldn't understand.
Wait a minute --
Listen to me --
No Mac, please... I --
What is it?!!
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Second verse!
Someone better tell Mac.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Grant, where'd you go?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
That wasn't a good night, no.
What are you doing?!
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
When I buy my zoo, I'm leaving them things the hell out!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Hey there, Chief.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Flip.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Kate McConnell.
Why're you driving so fast?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Well?...
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Driving, talking to me...
Anything?
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
I'm begging.
Order up!
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Also boring.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Loud and clear.
You know how to drive one of these things?
We still on schedule?
Bandit?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
Do I have a choice?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I hate to say it...
I'm all ears.
You're coming up to the scale house.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
I think you're just yellow.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Five thou.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Maroon uniforms?
Two of 'em?
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Are you on a land line?
I've got concerns.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
That's probably him now...
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
...When did you know all this?
...Are you insane?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
Wow.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
For real?
True?
That takes some of the sting out.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
Why would you let her to do that?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
What will you say?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
They come when you sleep.
What do you want?
When did this happen?
Jesus...
What are they?
Rheya...
Not a very happy poem.
I wasn't.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
What do you remember?
Is it intelligent?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
What's wrong.
But we fought.
But that's what happened before.
What's happening to us?
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
How can you be here...
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You want it coming back with us?
Occasionally.
I'm supposed to call in.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
Would you pick one out, please?
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Let's get a drink.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Yeah.  It was.
What do you want to do?
Are you okay?
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
When can I see you?
Claire...
What a memory.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... just saying you should think twice about it...
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
My ass if falling.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
So how'd it go?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
What shit, honey?
Honey.  You got him.
Bought it.
Why?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Even Joey Venza?!
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Who's Joey Venza?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
How do I know that's her?
Under the table.
Watch your step!
How do you know where the gun is?
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
Well, look who's dressing for success.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Are you quite finished?
Good morning, Liz.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
I hate--
Sit down and stop being such a child.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Well, no.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
I... I like you.  A lot.
I'll introduce you.
It's Friday night...
The record--
Absolutely no class.
A match made in heaven.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering\85 the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron\85
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
Your dog ate it.
Need any more help?
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Why? It is a wrestling match, or\85
So they're airing this tonight?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
What's wrong with him?
Come on!
Ready?
Three's a crowd, especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire.  Here's the wire cutters.  Are the civilian clothes ready?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
You make my mouth water.
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
What some brandy?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
It is.
Jawohl!
What is this? This is water?
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
May I have this dance, Miss?
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Who did?
Go on.
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Shapiro. Shapiro.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
We have no radio.
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You heard him.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
What?
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Can you locate them?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
Left behind?
These are my children...my children.
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Yes.  Thank you.
Oh
But I do have a theory...
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
I've spent eighty years looking for another way, Captain. This is the only one.  Of course, you could always come with me. You fancy yourself an explorer. Here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced.
The royal...studs?
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
It is a Class D-12 Bird of Prey. They were retired from service because of defective plasma coils.
Status!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel.
Aye sir, coding now.
Could it be Spock's?
I don't believe it...
David, I don't understand...
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
.          .. Spock's tube...
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Later. Let's go...
Why?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
Is there <U>anything</U> we can do?!
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
Why would you do this...?
See! That shimmering area.
Close... There --
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
May I ask why...?
David?... David!
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Bones!...
How can you tell that?
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Sir, may I --
You amaze me, Commander.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
They even killed the galley chief.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
So are we, it looks like.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
Don't tell me you've got something.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
We encoded four minutes --
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Time's up, Admiral...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot\82g\82's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
Hrummm... and where are you off to, now?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship.  It's coming through now, Khan...
A distinct possibility.
What IS working around here?
That's it?
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
... the good of the few...
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Admiral?
Mr. Saavik, all stop.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Mr. Sulu... The shields!
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Fire all phasers...!
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I do this because I was there,
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
Oh, joy.
What did you say she was getting?
Hi... Busy?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
You, ah...  You present the appearance of a man with a problem.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Who are you? Doctor Adams was supposed to assist me.
What's causing that!?
Damage report!
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
Go ahead. Stun me.
We are in an enemy wessel, sir. I didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Status report, Admiral!
So you were at Berkeley.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
Thanks.
Then --
Or believe, I'll bet.
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
... Who are you?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Spock...?
Earth... But when?... Spock?
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Spock...
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
Admiral. Full power is restored.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock: Condition report!
10 seconds, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Bearing!
Unidentified aircraft, 40,000 feet MSL, range 30 miles, bearing 010.
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Right on. You fly?
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
A perfect moment?
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Anij!
No... I want to stay with you...
Won't he rust?
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Very funny...
She's stabilizing.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
There is an alternative to an all- out assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them.
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
Will that stop the tear?
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
... Population three hundred million...
Why would we be involved with these people?
What you're doing to my neck...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I'm not sleeping well...
What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher...  Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
Augh.
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Montana.  Energize.
It's Cochrane.
I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right?
How long has he been unconscious?
Is it Japanese?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Can you configure it?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Did you know her?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
Where?
This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
What's still there?
Main bus...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Where in the States?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
You seem to have an answer for everything.
Invasion.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
What?
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Friends from Cornell...
You're leaving, aren't you?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Captain...?
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Target locked!
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Report.
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Good luck, sir.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Report!
Emergency override!
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
Worf? Is something wrong?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Uh, Jim...
What the Hell's going on?
Thanks...
Figures.
Bones, why don't you see what you can do? Let them know we're not holding a grudge.
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
Would you care to go topside?
My God, what happened here?
WHAT HAPPENED?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
Just the size of my head -
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
Shields. Battle stations.
I've heard of chameloids - "Shapeshifters" - I thought you were mythical.
How did you know...?
How much time's left of your sentence?
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
I know how to get outside the shield.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Who is "US?"
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
According to my information, today.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
What is it?
Spock, I'm really tired...
Where?
The peace conference.
I was blind. I couldn't see past the death of my son. I couldn't trust.
Control tower, reading, Sir.
It's pretty chaotic over there. There's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting...
You must have faith.
How did you - ?
Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
Trouble?
Sir?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
At least we must keep track of where they are taken, sir. I -
That could take hours!
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Brother. I cannot move.
No. I must deactivate you.
When was he... created?
Remember him?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
How long does he have?
So... To happy endings.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
Yes.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
We are being hailed.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
If you wouldn't mind.
Counselor.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
We're being hailed.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
It's working.
Sir?
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Not so long.
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
It\92s too late.
My God...
Praetor...
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Benny, God, take it easy...
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Make any money?
Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
I don't like it, George...
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
That's the chance we have to take.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
No deal.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
Steering wheel...
What?!
Money.
What?!
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Are you from up there? Space?
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
When do you have to be here?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
What is hitchhike?
Say it.
The driver will...
You want this ticket?
Well... I'm going to go now.
You thought we were a different planet?!
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
Nobody knows.
I like this music.
I am not a good singer.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
You can have one.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
What will you say about us?
Well...
Help me!!!
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Is there a reward in this?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
You can't just... kill him.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
He has his uses too.
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
No.
Clips.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Top ten.
Hey, the last day of the world and you spend it in bed.
Looks like she was holding out.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
So there never was a death squad.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
About what?
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
That would be no.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
Jesus, Lenny.
What is it?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
And what about the guy that was following me?
What is it?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Tell me.
Mace... you're a girl.
You see Tran?
What is that?
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Testa?
No.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
You run the plates?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
You heard?
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Look...
My God.
You're a... you're sick.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
He said it was a clue?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
We have another one.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Do you think he singled you out?
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Miss me, Dave?
This is a sexy case.
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
There are Agency regulations about this.
It's a no-no.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again?
It's quite advanced.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
What happened?
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Who are you?
Agent Mackelway?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Suspect Zero?
I don't carry it with me.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Thomas Mackelway.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me, go on a talk show, give me a nickname?
Ever since I've known you.
I'm sorry?
Thanks.
Yeah.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
I'm Mike.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
I thought I was going to die.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
They're out of Glenlivet.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Oh my God.
The poor thing. Six years?
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
Well... This is it.
I'll be around.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Well, I should be getting...
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
You know, us.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
That doesn't sound too good for business.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
There are so many beautiful women here.
I got to at least try once.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
What's he do?
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
That's right.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
VEGAS.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Wake up, baby.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
Mikey's the big winner.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
I'm Mike...  and this is my friend "Doubledown Trent".
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
Sorry about interrupting...
She didn't like me, anyway.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
How you guys doing?
What are you doing?
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
Because he's a bitch.
What a surprise...
Yes she did.
That was pretty cold, dude.
It's on.
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...honestly...
...Anaheim...
It's on...
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
You heard about your father?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
What miracles you do for strangers.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
You tell us about America.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike, you sure about Moe selling. He never mentioned it to me and he loves the business.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
We should hear what they have to say.
One of Tattaglia's people?
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Then Luca turned to the other man...
What will your father say?
Michael.
I can't...
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Send some bodyguards.
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
What is it?
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
I think so.  Detective squad?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
You like jazz!
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
I know. I write like a child.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
Freddie?
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Why?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
What?
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Marge-maintenance.
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Hardly.
Freddie, do you have something to say?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Tom.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Where does Dickie live?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
Very.
I found Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
It's all true.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
How would you know that?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
Is this you?
This is spectacular.
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?
Ditto.
Will we see you later?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
My God.
That's good, isn't it?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Hello. What are you up to?
How was it?
Was that Meredith?
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
And don't forget. I have the key.
Dickie Greenleaf?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
No!
It is a little coarse, yes.
Absolutely.
You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket?
You like ball games?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Why?
I don't know...
The moon?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
This is sort of high class...
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
20 bucks?
What's your name?
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do you understand why I came here?
Can I see you again?
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
Who's a killer?
Why should it be grounded?
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
There must be something...
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
Some. Here and there.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Is that so?
I'm hip.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
So howsit?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Well, I just, you know...
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Had a close one.
Not really.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
Thank you.
Spit it out.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Well yes I suppose ...
Limp dick?
I'll go.
Wait.
I believe you.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Me too.
You first.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
We were in love... weren't we?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Now, did you remember that, or...
I see...
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
Yes it does.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Here we are.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
We've been closed for a while.
Didn't you have any help?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
You kids off to the dance?
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Cigarette?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
That was beautiful.
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Is there a young Tim?
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
It's about me.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
You mean, he was... let go, too?
Ancestors?
They all know you?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Yes?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
How do you like our little hamlet?
San Francisco.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
I don't understand.
Is anyone there?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
They haven't harmed anyone.
Is smoking fun?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
What?
Good morning.
Where does he live?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
The two kids?
Daniels.
Thank you.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
You did say birds?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
When do you think they'll come?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here. 
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
He's not home.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
I understand completely, sir.
Doesn't what make me...?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
So you're a lawyer.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
Why... 
Yes.
You like me, huh?
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Why did he shoot her?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I have several jobs.
I do different things on different days.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Really? Tell me about it.
Of birds?
What it was, probably...
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
There we are!
That... that... who was that?
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
For what purpose?
I don't know why.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
How do you plan to do that?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I haven't finished my drink.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
Dr. MacFarlane --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
But you did promise.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
She's unconscious.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
What's that you say?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
This is not a woman!
I thought this was a school day.
You'll not need that again, Georgina.
Not much danger here, ma'am, I wouldn't think -- right here in the heart of Edinburgh.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
You?  Why?  Since when have you become the protector of little children?
You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
I would make you rich.
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
But where did they get those people?
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
How long ago?
You think it'll spoil the boy, eh? Was I not assistant to Knox?
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
We won't.
Two down. Two to go.
Think maybe knives do?
You lied at my trial.
What did they give you?
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
No. You don't.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
How about sign of a big black bird?
Cause if you're losing your mind, I got a right to know.
An accident, Nathan.
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Erin!
What? What is it?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
Sweetheart...
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
No foolin'? Will you?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
We certainly did.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Hello--
I wonder if we ought to--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
Everyone seems so-- 
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Oh -- hello--
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
What happened?
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Why not?
Where are you going now?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Well... we blew Plan A.
All together?
They're looking at us.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Death to all vampires!
Don't!  Stop!
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
Don't go out there!  Stop him!
Dad!  Don't sneak up on people like that!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Hi... I'm Laddie.
It was a dream, Star.
I'll hitch.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
What did you say?
-- a job.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Max!  What's wrong?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Max... what are you talking about?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
Now you and David...
Let's go see them.
They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they?
It's gone.  I feel it!
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
This is kind of a cool place.
You're beautiful.
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
What??
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Know what you mean, Blair.  Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord.
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
You catch anything he was saying?
Torch it over there!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
What are you doing?
Anything?
What are you doing?
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
We're on fire!
How long's it been?
What's...
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Somebody definitely messed with it.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
What if it doesn't come?
He might just wait us out.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
What's happened?!
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Yes.  Just about here.
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
It's what they want you to see.
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
Vox --
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
No, we created the Morlocks.
What?
I'm tired of running.
And why not?
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Well there's something new.
Dance with me...
Alex, what is it?
Alex...?!
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
We took a walk three days ago.
Heavens, look at that now!
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
I've been working.
I'm sorry, David.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
But you won't listen.  You won't see me, you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You wouldn't believe me.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I can't do that --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
How long did you travel?
Is there a lot of illness?
Oh, that explains everything.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
All of you?
And this is your "work"?
The mud carriers.
Alexander...?
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
My father has gone to a better place.
Where do they take them?!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
You know that's not true.
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Yes, sir.
How did you get hurt?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Sir?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Relax.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today, Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men, Starks.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Did you know my father?
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
We're late.
What should they be looking for?
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
You done with your small talk?
[Beat] What's your name?
But I like it I guess.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How long do we have?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
What? What are you thinking?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
What?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Who...who kills me?
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
You know how to get there?
Can you drive?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
I'm not sure.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
This is pretty good. Considering...
This is a great song.
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
On what?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
Oh shit.
Stop.
So how come you don't have any kids?
Louise!  Where are you?  Are you alright?  Honey...
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Where'd y'all go?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Tell me now.
What?
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?
Front.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Whose place is this again?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Oh my God.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
But you think he fools around.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Before.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
You do?
What?
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Isn't it beautiful?!!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Well why don't you look her up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
Well then you've got to call her, man.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
Who?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Here's the info you asked for.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Turn it up, Magda.
Urrggghh...
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I don't buy it.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
You bet.
Among others.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Friend. Baseball bat.
A salesman -- that's what I am. I mean, I'm gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own company -- video sales -- just as soon as I get enough seed money.
I see where you're going.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Bundt cake?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
What's up?
I think you'd better sit down.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh, are you on the team?
Ted, are you okay?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Well... why don't you move back?
Get out.
But but what about Steve?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
Piggyback ride.
Franks and beans!
How are you doing, Warren?
See you, Warren.
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us.
How long until the army is ready?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
What's happened?
How's my favorite President?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Secretary of Defense...
So what've we got today?
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I don't like what's happening.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
I don't want to listen to this again.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Hello?
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
It's transparent. The press'll be all over it.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
Leo's gotta get to burial, Brother. He's gotta make the journey.
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Tread matches. It's the car.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
Ray...
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Why does he wanna see me?
What did he say?
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Not no more.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
What's that?
1868...
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
This Jimmy's?
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
I desecrated it?
Ray. X22.
With an Indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective Operations Unit, and it'll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
What ya want?
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
How so?
Yeah, most likely.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
Why not?
The what?
It never came up.
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
I can't.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
What if he's not?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
It dies. We live.
Does it bother you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
And now I want you.
Well no...inverse order.
Just good luck.
This is it, then.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
No.
How do you play reality.
Want to play the game?
Looks like a tie.
Tomcats?
Yes, Sergeant?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Now have you got it?  Have you still got it?
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
The list is long, but distinguished.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
What was that?
I've lost him -- where is he?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Something bothering you?
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
That's Kazanski.
I was a victim of circumstance.
A plaque?
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
Coogan spent half the night looking for her. He said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
GET LOST!
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Need a hint?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
Helping him in.
He's a good pilot.
Yes sir..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
Not something they tell dependents.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
What happened to number five?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
If I wanted him dead, you moron, I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Bob?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Not since you lost him.
HER!
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Hey, Quaid!
What trip?
I want that fucker dead.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Is that better?
Who is she?
...You mean it?
Lori...
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Our friends, my job, eight years together, I suppose all this was implanted too?
I love you.
All right.
Go on.
I love you.
...What?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
I said get out!
What reactor?!
...Who are you?
You guys all set?
Yeah, still got one poking around.
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Knock it off, Burt!
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
I might have an idea...
You know, up the jeep trail.
Oh my God.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
You didn't cook breakfast?
You're gonna get us hung up.
You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
So long, cactus!
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
We'll take your word for it.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Watch your ass, shithead.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Come on, you're not going to do your lasso thing...?
They're...they're trying to make us move!
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Twenty.
I've got a plan.  You and Val take your truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby.  Get us some help.
Darn it!
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
I brought it... to the coroner.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Or this -- is this a significant difference?
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
I noticed.
Oh really?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
We have a full caseload, Rog.
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
...So what would we claim? He stabbed Duane Lindeman in self-defense?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
-- What?
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
You do.
Racist asshole came at me.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
Afraid of what?
'lo, Cecil.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
Now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side, or you want to walk into any restaurant in Chinatown and get free dumplings...
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
No.
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
What color hair will she have?
Tell me some other things about her.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Is there a golf course around here?
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
HE'S GONE.
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks. Jack said you knew her. How well?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
No.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
I see. He does talk loud.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
You better dust this place, Sam.
Take a look at this.
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Oh god, Laura.
Laura?
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Where are you going?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
Laura, I am your friend.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
Bob.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
This afternoon?
What's going on?
What do you mean?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
You want to see...
You're getting warmer.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Laura.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
Good night, Mom.
Hi, honey, how's Donna?
Let me see.
No.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Dad?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you get this from your lover?
When's the next business trip, big fella?
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
You're right. There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
What are you doing here?
Yes.  It is a crime. A serious crime.
They lied.
That's not my handwriting.
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Neurology?
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
Yes.
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Kathy Price...
Yes.
A single hour.
What is it?
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
Nothing further, your Honor...
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
Well, then what are you doing here?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
Joe...  Joe...
You're pressuring yourself...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Well, well, well. Huh?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
Who have we got?
No.
Right.
Right.
So what?
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
Dr. Towler...
...of the procedures...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
You look kinda lost yourself.
You seem to know a lot about him.
How does it happen cars are running?
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
The Rockies...!  You'd rather get back to that big family of yours in Minnesota, wouldn't you?
What is that gizmo?!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
Must be somebody in there.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Can I read it?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Just be careful, okay?
He's had some sort of...episode.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Doctor...
What?
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
And...what's the man doing?
In what, a romantic comedy?
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
What...happened?
You're not crazy, by the way.
You didn't jump in.
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
I want to see the body.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
That was Nancy, not me!
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
Looks like weather.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Come in.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I couldn't have done it without you.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Sorry to here it.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
What the hell is going on?
How ya doing?
Good.
No way!
My parents don't do it anymore.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
What is it we can do for you today?
And being sixteen.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
What?  Come on...
It matters to me.
I don't.
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
About yourself?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
For killing a dolphin.
Yes, that's true.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
And you didn't do anything about it?
If this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Y'all take American Express?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
This your car?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
No.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Whattaya mean family?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
What's she doin' here?
What is it?
You heard from Reggie?
Club Zanzibar.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
So, it's back to the islands.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
You won't of missed much.
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
In a fire, as I recall.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
That don't smell like a More.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Huh?
You got me, peanut.
I do.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
More'n likely.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You knew my daddy?
How'd you know my daddy?
Oh God, Sailor.
And no AC.
Sailor?
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Let's leave here.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
Mama???
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Where? In the leg?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
You got nice tits.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Where we goin'?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
You snore.
Emily?
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
I just mean...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Yes.
Tripp?!
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Kidnapped? By who?
Which is?
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Want some help with that?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
Me? What can I do?
No...
You driving this car?
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
I know.
She told you about...
Vernon.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Boy or girl?
Hello?
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
So what are you doing out here?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Oh.
Professor Tripp?
How did I get here last night?
Isn't this...?
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Kinship. And what's here?
So, why did you take me up there?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
You're lying.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
But, last night...
You coming?
Get out of here.
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
Yes, Hannah?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
Who's gun is that?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
I lost it all.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Disturbed. And when your friend Crabtree gets done with him, he's going to be even more disturbed.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
Grady?
Excuse me?
Who's that guy?
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Where you stand?
Nothing's wrong. They went to Wellesley together.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
No, the dog.
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
Don't need to think fast to handle beer.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Hey, is that a school?
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
Then what? What?!
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
There's a million birds here.
They're starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
It's just a city park.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
Try.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
I have to go.
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
What's up?
I haven't broken any laws.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You don't know?
I wasn't feeling well.
I'd say you're moving.
The passionate one?
And your new apartment?
Just trying to be helpful.
Yeah, like the bird.
No.
Robin?
No thank you.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
But will he... ?
No.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
It's very good, indeed.
How's the journal?
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Fuck you, Rosen!
You don't know!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
Close your eyes.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
No, I am not going to --
Who do you see?
Where are you?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
I'm talking about you.
Southern light.
Doesn't it get noisy?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
So?
Hey, that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
How about in the morning.
It's not what you think.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
I love my brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
Neither am I.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
What's this?
I don't need a plant.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
She-hit.
How you guys doing?
Nice shot, Lins.
What's goin' on, Boss?
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
What about O-2?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level.  They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  Put it under intelligent control.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Well, that's that.
You see where it's coming in?
I don't know how!
Alright, put this on.
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
No, Bud, no... not you.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Do we just leave him there?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
Y'all could be more specific.
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
4800 feet.  It's official.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Which one shall I wear?
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
Well?
Shall we go for a swim?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Oh, Sandro...
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
Claudia, listen to me...
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Then why do you say them?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Then I'll see you later.
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Have you ever been in love?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
And tell Corrado, too, that I'm here... if he wants me. You can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad, and that at this moment, it's the only thing that interests me. Is that clear?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
But how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
Let's try to be practical about this. The best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station, or something, and report the disappearance. I'll remain here... because... well, I don't know, but it seems to me that something may turn up. Anyway, I just don't feel like leaving.
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
And what are we going to do now?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
We have a radio like this, too.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Thank you.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc\82.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
No.
No.
Because I'm getting fat.
I'm a blimp.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
I don't know.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
What do you mean?
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
No I'm not.
Well, who in particular?
Do you think he loves you?
Where do you meet?
Something I ate.
I got sicker.
I... I don't understand.
Don't you know?
What's your real name?
Would you like to be?
Why do you smoke?
Do you know a Marie?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you?
What did you do?
Yes?
How does she know that?
Oh, yes.
Are you pretty?
You're a mistake.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
To be a mother?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Would you like to tell me?
And then what happened?
A crucifix.
Who?
Is someone in the room with you?
Agnes, can you hear me?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Him.
Stay away from me...
You saw it all didn't you?
Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
Larry...
Martha, it's you.
All I want is one more week.
No, no, no...
It's your favourite...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I can beat that.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Was there a priest?
What's his name?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
That's absurd!
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
The Catholic Church...
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
She is not a child.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
All right, what do you need.
Oh, Dear God...
An unhappy woman...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear.  Does my smoking bother you?
Would you like one?  Huh?
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
For Agnes.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Somebody told her.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Was it you?
Too late for what?
The baby?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
She can't remember.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
I'm a deserter.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Eh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
I don't think that bit's right.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
No, I didn't you did ...
Oh!
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Are you pulling my leg?
Thank you.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are you doing?
What are they saying?
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
With a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.
Anything to spare?
That little old man.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.  Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Well, you look like him.
My eyes are lighter.
And my nose...
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
He's betrayed the class.
Temper! Temper!
I've got the stuff. Come here.
He belongs to Paul.
What?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
If there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid, it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
Do you remember the pyramid?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
What is it?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Can we come up?
Are you okay in there?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
You like this shit?
What happened to the lights?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Hey, guess what?
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's clear.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Now we're in for it.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Listen, it sure didn't like this flamethrower.
Now what's wrong?
Can you get them back?
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
It's close, real close.
This looks ancient.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
That sounds a little fanciful...
I thought I'd find you here.
That's the one about the albatross, right?
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
They're on the next level up.
Source of transmission is to the northeast... about 300 meters.
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
We do know that.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Let's hear it.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
But?
Still worried?
Here, Chaz.
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Where did the parasites come from?
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Yes!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Now what?
Are you <u>crazy</u>?
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No... don't...
What is it?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
It's a rhino.
Yeah, it's fine.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Seal everything now!
I found it...
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Picking up velocity.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
One of 'em must have escaped.
Still got him?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
That's what we thought.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Thanks.
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Four.
Seltzer?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Where'd you leave them?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Hello, there. Who are you?
And what is your name?
May I come in?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
Hungry?
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
You sat and talked until it was light...
You used my name and my column to blackmail Karen into getting you the part of "Cora" - and you lied to me about it!
We never met. That's why.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
In time she'll be what you are.
Bill...
Bill!
When? When are you going to do it?
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Yeah... I will.
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
Thank you.
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Just wondered what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Every day.
Yes. Yes, it does.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
- and for you.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
You need new girdles.
She works hard.
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Not just that way. As a friend...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Did you see it here in New York?
The curtains. I made them myself.
I've got it.
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Ain't it the truth?
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
She's just outside the door.
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
How much time have we?
How far to the station?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Do you want it on?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Well of all-
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Would you, really? How sweet-
How about calling it a night?
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
When you do, let me in on it.
Don't be evasive.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
You've been talking to that venomous fishwife, Addison deWitt-
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
I don't think I could be.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
When's the audition?
You get quick action, don't you?
--no way--
Carl?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
That was fun.  What now?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--we gotta top the Times--
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
What would you have done?
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I think that's him.
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
What does it say?
--what time is it?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
Donald Segretti?
According to what we've been able to verify, you've been busy.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
But you know who did.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
Speak.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
I don't think either Metropolitan or National should cover the story.  I don't think we should cover the story, period.
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Yes, sir.
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
How grand?
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
Your name, please.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
What'd you get on W.House?
Who's Charles Colson?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
Howard--
Does "they" mean the White House?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
A boy or a girl?
What the hell was that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
What did you just say?
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
Just go!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Do I have to?
Nice car.
What?  No I'm not.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
This isn't any better, Chris.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
Do you?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
You're so big!
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Ow, what the hell?
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
I have no idea.  Finch showers in a bathing suit.
But, but -- what would I do?
That's stupid.
Hey, minuteman.
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
What the heck is this?
Dad!!
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
Whatever you want.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Okay, I get it.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
This was remade?  Into what?
So you need to change, right?
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Oh...ungghhhhh!
That's my trick!
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
But you don't love me.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
Victoria...I love you.
That was a great night.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
What reputation?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
NOVA!!
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Ha-ha!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Claude...?
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
We know you were with her.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Shit. I feel sick.
What did she say?
Now!
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Are you running away?
Who did you hear it from?
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
Did I tell you that?
No! I look ridiculous!
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
I'm sorry.
I'm so scared...
Don't let me go!
Do you remember this?
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't you, child?
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Why does everyone have to act that way?
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
What was that?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Hey!
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
You're like New York. You're an island.
What do you mean, next?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
We've been through this.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Oh!
I-you know, I don't wanna.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Right!  Where?
All right.
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Your grammy!
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Why not?
Yeah.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Okay?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Those are the two categories...
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Don't you think I do?
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
M'hm.
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Well, what is your definition of following?
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
I'm home!
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
David! David! I can't believe this!
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh, Jesus, really?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
Remember, we had that thing.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
That's sick!
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Yeah, this place is great.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Man, that's great. That's just great.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
I mean that as a compliment.
Probably on their first date, right?
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Yeah, watch the road!
I have some very good memories there.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
You wanna lie down?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
There's a whole wing in this house.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Did you know the contractor?
Did you see permits?  Did he have a license?
Like you didn't know.  Who invited the bimbo?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
I have a small window of time.
I don't know how to make her funny.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
So where is young Jonah?
Would you leave us alone right now?
Take good care of it.
That for us?
Just did.  Jealous?
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
And?
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Go.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
What?
I mean, you're really back.
Don't get it.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Otis!  No barking!
Yes.
Okay, knock it off.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
You walked out on a five year marriage.
And how hard it hit?
What are you saying?
Anyone else?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I know.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
Happy anniversary.
Coffee?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
Ours.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
And Ryan works at home.
Are you okay?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
Jesus Christ.
I don't need a drug.
I'm so sorry.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you lovesick?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
Like the last time.
Okay.
Everyday.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Um.  Happy for you.
So tell me, how's it going?
Panes?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Nevermind.
She's such a great photographer.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
I don't have a drug problem.
Break's over.
Tell me about it.
So, um...how was your day?  What did you do?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
And you are...?
You dance...
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
So what makes you so special?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Who is that idiot?
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Affirmative.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
May I cut in?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, I know.
What did I tell you?
All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Say, you got a lulu.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
I hope everything goes all right.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
No.
You mean tonight?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Three.
Who?
What's your friend's name?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
You are?
Why not?
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Mind if I come in?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Last night?
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
The Vice Squad?
Who?
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where is your apartment?
How do you work it with the key?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I am?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Oh, yes. Thanks.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
I see.
Very clever.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
You can't come in.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Good evening, Baxter.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
What's her name?
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
How do you spell her last name?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
Who is Mickey?
You got a girl-friend?
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Sleeping pills.
Will you excuse me?
I missed you, Fran.
I want you back, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Are you there, Fran?
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
What are you talking about?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Two whole drums --
How about a drink ?
What unit were you with ?
Rangers, eh?
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
And the grass?
That's a light down there --
What are we doing here?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Well, get in there.
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
Will they attack?
Who knows? Right.
I never heard about that.
How did they know?
No, sir.
I thought he was a lame.
American weapons?
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
What's your name, sailor ?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
What'd you do for supplies?
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
It's gonna blow this place out. It's gonna ruin it ...
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You've gone crazy.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
Go away -- hide yourself.
I had immense plans.
Did you know him very well?
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
What's that?
This one , Lance?
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
What?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Who are you?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Are you warm, Captain?
What if I say no.
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
30   CONTINUED:
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
212  CONTINUED:
How long have you been up north?
Had?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
You're hurt.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
A lot to ask, dragging him away from such a good-looking girl --
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Stay put!
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Be my guest.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
Don't push me..!
I already have.
Can you walk?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Why the smirk?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Me. My home number is on this card.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Why did yo do this for me?
What needs clearing up?
So you'll be at work?
What's this?
Getting loud, getting loud.
So. Anything else?
The stiff one eye?
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Thanks, Melvin.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
You don't owe me that.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Was this supposed to be your room?
No!!!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
Hey -- you called me... I...
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Shall I get her for you?
Sorry. What are those cards?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
What?
Did you... do something to him?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I carry bacon in my pocket.
What's wrong?
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
Yeah.
You can't --
Bain.  Michael Bain.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Five million dollars?
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
Where have you been, Robert?
Who?
Get on the expressway.
Twenty large?  That's all?
He wants to kill you?
And you want to use me to get him?
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
How?
No.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Women?  No... not really.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
Do you think about the game?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
In Costa Blanca.
What do you think he's doing?
You should knock.
Where did you learn it?
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
I paid a lot for these.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
What?
Yes.
What did he want?
What did he say?
Was that it?
Ten years later, here you are again.
Nobody ever sees me.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
What are you doing?
Can I ask you something?
It happened to you before?
Was she the only one?
I waited another four minutes.
I'm taking off my mike.
Was nice.
I wasn't watching television.
I thought it was interesting --
Hi.  Did you call --
Why are you working today?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Then, I'll sail alone.
I think I've heard of you.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
How would you like the funds?
This will take some time.
Of course, senor.
He_s the closest we've got to an intellectual.
Because it's in English?
You guys having a go a me or what?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Look I gotta get going, shouldn't you have met Katka?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Perfect!
So why didn't we?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Red or white?
I don't want to ruin your day.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Now you're using that word.
Doug, I can't just leave you!
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
What about me?
You don't understand, I can't!
It's that one isn't it.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
I've been around.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Hi, want to take up dancing?
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
About forty minutes.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
I thought I'd help out.
Seems a shame!
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Shall I wash these out?
I'd better get you to a hospital.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
This is your doing?
Why did you break into that particular building?
Really!
And the students?
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Sure!
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
So, he didn't fire you?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I think we should be going honey.
I don't want to go.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
What are you an idiot!
Have you lost all control of this city?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
Out with Belinda?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I told him to leave me alone.
What are you doing here?
Deranged.
She's like some Puritan.
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I'm very sorry --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
'I hope your dreams come true.'
So what else is on this list?
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Because I try to be nice to people?
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
You have to believe to have faith.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Oh. Just not at school...
All of it.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
So you're talking to me?
What does that mean?!
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
You make me feel...
What's wr--?
When did you build this?
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
By accident --
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm asking how much.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
This week.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
You know about this stuff?
You've been well?
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
This... is the number one single?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
You remember me...?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Uh, hi, Eileen.
Huh?
'Bike fine point?'
Your line, George!
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
What?!
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Professor? Professor Brown?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
That's all taken care of.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Yeah, I guess.
That's what he told you, huh?
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Sure is pretty.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Doing what?
Can I be honest?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Somebody else is going to get it.
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
Why?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Look at all this junk.
Is he upset?
Think I got 'em?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Don't.
I'd like to get out of here.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Okay, friend. Start running.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Then what?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
You okay?
You're a welcome sight...
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Buckaroo--! Sorry--
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Raise your hand...where?
He offered you money?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
The girl I remind you of.
You keep an eye on it.
Oh, my.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
Pick those up, Reno.
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this \96 believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I \96 I'm sorry - listen, how are you \96 I'm sorry. You doing okay?
If you could, I'd \96
Hello, Barton.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Before what?
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
...This'll sometimes help.
M'honey pretends to be impatient with me, Barton, but she'll put up with anything.
Chet!
No, I \96 I didn't mean to sound \96
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man \96 to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent \96 don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
...Huh? No, I'm \96
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
A souse!
I didn't say anything-
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
Go ahead, son.
...Barton, is everything okay?
Sound a little what?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people \96 that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need \96 a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you \96 newspaperman did you say?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and \96 and \96 and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself \96
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Did I say rude? People can be goddamn cruel. Especially some of their housewives. Okay, so I've got a weight problem. That's my cross to bear. I dunno...
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
Yeah, but \96
...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean to a guy from New York.
...Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Hold on \96
Jesus... They can tell that...
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Yes, thank you.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
Transient or resident?
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
He teach you to do it?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Take care, you hear?
How about the booze?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
I had him in two classes.
You should do something about this lock.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Did you leave the club with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Do you have a cigarette?
Did I miss something?
But you didn't hurt --
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I passed.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I didn't.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
About three months before I met you.
Can I talk to you a minute?
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
I finished my book.
What do we do now, Nick?
I hate rugrats.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
You workin' on another book?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
I never heard of him.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
I don't know.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
How old was she when this happened?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Of what?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Saddle River, New York!
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
How much for these five?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Yes, I understand \96 but where do you take them from?
Not what?
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called \96 hmmm...  \96 yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Would you like to see the wine list?
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
\96 In this corner?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You got a date already?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
You're shattering all my myths.
Check you later, man.
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
I don't really have any problems.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
Do you know what he's saying?
You're back.
It looks done.
... babies.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were \96
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
Is that the best quality you have?
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
How can I ever thank you?
What? What do you want?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
That one's for you.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
OK! Goodbye!
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
How could you?  I'm a woman...
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Admiring your handiwork?
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
I'm listed.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Ten, nine...
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
I don't.  So, no.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
Alfred, are you...?
Sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
How did you...?
Remember the victim at the airport. Toxins introduced through the mouth.
We gotta get those locks changed.
No sign of the snowman.
If we could relay the sunlight-
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
That's gotta hurt.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Make yourself right at home.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
I'm Batman? I remember my life as Bruce Wayne.  But all this. It's like the life of a stranger.
There's one other thing. I feel..
Master, Bruce?
All the answers are numbers.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
Now black rubber.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
So glad you could come.
What? Oh, it's very impressive.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
To kill me.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But...
Fast work. You just moved here.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
Okay. I'm outta here.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Chase?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
Holy shit.
No.  Wait...
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
How much do you weigh?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
What is that?
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
Great.  Give me a grant.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
No.
What did you see?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
... Why the mask?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I think it ....
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Scottish.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
Sort of half.....
Everything's gonna be fine.
shhh...
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
No!
David, David, David ...
Welsh.
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  Not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
Shut up, Kevin.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Come on Sting!
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
This sucks.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Huh huh. This says Beavis.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
So, like, where is she?
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird. I think I'm freaking out.
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Well where is she?!
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Really? I poop too much.
This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Do her? Huh huh.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
We should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
Wave at the lion.
What?
Oh, honey, we may need that.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Here's something.
Honey.  Let's go.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
What...?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
What is going on?
Did you get the paint?
We studied all day yesterday. Don't tell me...
This is <u>my</u> town.
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
Are you available?
Just one daughter.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
What about Betelgeuse?
If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
I want to be dead too.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Your qu...?  But you're...
He's your cousin.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Answer your mother.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
They're... not here anymore.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
Is this the key to the attic?
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Their wedding clothes.
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
... Were you going somewhere?
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... He walked off...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
He does...?
Chauncey!
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes, it is very good!
I feel very good in here.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Certainly, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
... Then you really are a gardener?
... My suitcase.
Good morning, Louise.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
How were you paid?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
The Old Man gave me nice television sets, this one has remote control.  He has one just like it.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Correct.
Good morning, Mr. President.
Yes. It has.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
You heard?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Would you take me on a tour?
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
But we are quite certain, comrade, that this man Gardiner is a leading member of an American elitist faction planning a coup d'etat.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I don't know.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Which one is Elijah again?
Did you eat?
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
Now?
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
We?
Don't forget me.
Suck my dick!
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
People make mistakes.
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
I know. I'm sorry...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice.  Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Is that true?
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
What?
Who told you?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Impressions? Those are hard.
No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Yes, my dear?
Do you dream often?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
Anybody else?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
When?
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
She's not available.
Never heard of it.
Yeah?
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Good-bye, Maxine.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
You still know.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Be here. In case.
No. I mean work work.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
MAMA!
But mama..
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Somebody new there. A woman. Thought you might know who she is.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Jesus.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
What? What? You talking back to me?
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
This is our concern, Dude.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
NUSSING!
Excuse me?
Sir, please lower your voice--
What's this?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
They range up to three thousand.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Almost five!
What--
He peed on the Dude's rug--
If what's during league play?
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
What do you need that for, Dude?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
I like your style, Dude.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Well yeah...I know that.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Oh shit.  Walter.
...Huh?
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Thanks Walter.
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh-huh.
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your homework, Larry?
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Huh?
It is a fucking emergency.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
Well can we--
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
What about that shit about Vietnam!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Well?  Aren't you?
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Whatta we do about the Mex?
Why?
What was that?
how long since he was bitten?
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Why do you hate us so much?
You came back for me.
What do you think?
What do you really think?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Put it back in park, Blade.
True, but thanks to you, we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
We're locked in.
Any casualties?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Tell me something, Skid --
The hell are you fiddling with there?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Nope.  Back then we did not.
What about you?  You're not coming?
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
What took you so long?
Going somewhere?
Who dies first?
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
-- he's a vampire.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
How did you know?
What are you doing?!
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Any progress?
Are you all right?
But you -- died --
This isn't human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
No.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Inside the grave?
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Why are we here?
--how old?
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Yeah, so?
Druid Hill Park.
So says her website.
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
--or someone--
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
What'd you dream?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
Then I'm going--
Oh, Jesus, no--
Absolutely.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
This is a little nuts.
Okay, a blur.
Can't you like just divine it?
So lemme see it.
The witch?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
What movies?
We should be so lucky.
What about night?
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
English.
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
Hold this.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
<u>What</u>?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
What?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Oooh. Oooh.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
What?
Women miscarry all the--
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Elly Kedward?
Dad...?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Heather.
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
I should check on Anna.
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
....Ma'am?
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...Well I'll be damned.
Hello?
Ray?... What time is it?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...Ray?
...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...You leaving?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
It'll pass.
He needs a room, Dusty.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
...Anything else?
You want me to kill 'em.
...What?
...it's too damn risky.
Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short.
Red Label.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What's this?
Howdy stranger.
Is Marty here?
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Yes, but.
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Sure I'm alright. 
You can hit me, if you want to.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Who is Don?
Come in.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
What do you want to do?
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
I want you to hurt me.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
I'll call you.
Yeah, it's me.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Hold me, Don.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
What are you lookin' at?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Yeah, how did you know?
How is Central these days?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
So. what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Here's to. an interesting experience.
Yeah. but.
O.K.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. but I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
What am I going to do?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Shoot.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
What was that all about?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
My father has a gun at home.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Are you feeling okay?
How ya doin' Dad?
God. you scared me.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Let us walk.  From what I understand, Diego has bought a hundred and sixty acres, a marina, a hotel, and an airstrip.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Que va hacer?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Nothing like this back home.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
This is it for me.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Honey, your nose!
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
What can I do for you guys?
What the fuck is that?
Are you sure you want to do this in front of everyone?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
No?
No, my brother.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
Oh my G-d.
What type of planes do you have?
What's the matter, George?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Cocaine?  How much?
Surprised to see me?
Who's the cheapskate?
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
The man who gives us the airplanes.  The man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago. Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to open for us the gates of Hollywood, George?
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
Freedom.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
I swear.  On my life.
Because she's visiting me.
For instance, something like this?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
It's not enough.
Are we good?
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Read it.
No ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Who is speaking?
Are you ready, colonel?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
That's what my report will read.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
Objection sustained.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
She's innocent.
Tell the court about that, please.
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
She was here?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What happened after that?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
You'll be sorry?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Why does she come to you?
What did you prescribe for her?
High school?
I heard him say it.
Did he make your life miserable?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Who told you that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
P.M.
Hi, Joe.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Why not?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
How'd you meet Marsh?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Really?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
No, I don't have to believe you.  The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What are you going you doing?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
You don't need anybody.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
But Your Honor--
Really.
If he files are you going to take the case?
She sounds like quite a woman.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Why don't you talk to him now?
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
I don't know.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
Well, that's a long time.
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
What's he saying now?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Then why do you?
Bar across the street.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
She's changed.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Oh there you are.
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Help cook?
What?
You ought to write these stories down.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
My mistake. I apologize.
Francesca?
Am I interrupting anything?
I think he's running for town crier next year.
How about if I set the table?
Yes.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I can't do this, honey.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
What are you doing?
What do you want me to say?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
Where you going?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Is it true?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
You soundin' like the old man now.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Is this Hell?
What else?  Money.
I said, no thanks.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
We'll have to sneak in.
Let me see it.
What are we doing down here?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
You haven't?
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Need any help with those bags, Ma'am?
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
How the fuck can I open it?
Sit down, Gino!
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, what happened?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
I need you ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Fuck.
It's not here, Caesar.
You murdered Gino!
What?
Caesar, don't.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
How many'd you do?
What?  How about a drink?
Now, where the fuck is my money?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
A favor?
'63 Chevy.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
He's a launderer?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
I don't understand - ?
We're not that different, Corky.
Because it's the truth.
You mean Shelly?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
What if he sees you?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I'm just asking, what if?
Why?
He'll have to run.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
Yes.
I think so.
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Jason Bourne is dead.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You have your passport?
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Was it the break-in?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride.
I said ten thousand.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
What does that mean?
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Okay, so you're a victim.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
Where?
Look, I don't know what's up there.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
-- just --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
You knew he was coming.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
xxxxxx.
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
You have ID?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
Where's the dog?
Wait a minute --
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
xxxxxx...
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
What if it doesn't come back?
You drink rum?
...Be back.
I think we'd better have a look.
What have you got there?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Please, I've got to find Jill.
Long time no see!
What's the matter?
Hello, Jack!
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
How much do you know?
Christ! You do know it all!
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
What's she done?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Take her off the list.
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You think these are tits don't you?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Don't litter my cab!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why not?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Look at that - right on time.
Turn around!
They'll be there waiting.
Security.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
But if they did promote you
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
He is dead.
You'd never get away with it. Besides, you can't do that to somebody's refund. It's Christmas. There is one more option.
Here. What do I do next?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
I never signed the form.
No, you can't have any more chairs! There's only one left in here now, and I need that to sit on!  Oh ... er, sorry. Who are you?
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You want to take my console into your office?
My mother said it would be all right.
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
My husband's dead, isn't he?
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
But I could be anybody.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.
Sign here please.
What is it?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
A little precaution, sir. I've had traps set for me before now. There are people in Central Services who'd love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.
Can you fix it?
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
Is she dying?
Frank Pierce.
Is this what you gave Mary?
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
What about Kanita?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Let's do it!  It's Marcus, Love, only for you.
IB Bangin.
Excuse me. You are a very kind man. I can see that. A man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Sure, sure, give go.
Is he going to be alright?
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
Yes?
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Five years.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Who is it?
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
Don't give me that look.
I'll drink to that.
He got better.
I'm sorry.
Whatja doing?
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Oh no!--I just remembered.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
They'll just keep calling.
Faster! God!
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Stomach again.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
I don't like being handled.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
No.  Don't worry about it.
London.
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
It's nice to see you.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
I'd give anything if that were true.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
Did you bring your grey suit?
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
How'd it go?
No.
Did it really go well?
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
Don't go.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Let's go...
Okay.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Play back the last line...
Yes.  That's right.
I really have to go.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
...good-bye then.
What?
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
So he was indicted?
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
I got promoted for things like that.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Would you like to do me?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Walter can I ask you something?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
See you later -
You really like it?
Great!  What is it?
Look at the size of it!
More champagne, your majesty?
Goodbye.
Of course I do!
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Here you go, enjoy.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Put it in the middle of the room!
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
Are you trying to be funny?
What's the matter with you?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man look at that get up !
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Dead Cat!
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Hiya Carla.
You didn't mean to what?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Walter...Walter listen carefully.  I don't want you to make any more statues.  Do you understand? No more statues.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
When Carla comes by I'll talk to her.  She'll make up some nice invitations.  We'll have them printed up.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Did you see my cat?
I also saw the girl give you this.
Police officer.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I saw your...cat.
Hi.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
Hello Mayolia.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
Oh, OK.
What's wrong with you!?!
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
I look horrible.
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
Well, um... litter?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Man has a complex.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Yes.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Dying.
Buffy, honey?
What's Bobby gonna say?
You okay?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You're even weaker than the others.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Is that your car?
How are you doing?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
They were vampires, weren't they?
Where are you gonna go?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
You sure?
Who?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
Time to do what?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Everybody does.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Oh.  Sorry.
Put your head back.
Ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
How can you keep doing this?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Wait!
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
The mark of the Coven.
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  Like dealing.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
So, we're stupid now?
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
It's Skip, for you.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
What do I got?
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Settle what?
Why am I a fuck?
No.
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
I'd kill ya.
No way.
Who you calling a "boy"?
No.
Struck out eighteen...
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
It's a miracle.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Well, I'd rather not say.
Look at yours.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
You were wandering around.
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Oh, good.
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Hey!
Okay.
She's not here, Sam.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Hey, Ace.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
All right, fine.
You lost your control.
Listen, I would -
Okay?
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
What - what, Caesar's?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
She was afraid to call you.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
You've got to stop her.
Half of everything is mine.
Now, he's really pissed.
Okay. Just take it easy.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You all right?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You're with me now.
You sure?
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
With the money.
I bought him a watch too.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
She had the same.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I was with somebody.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Oh, sh-
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Get - Get up! Get up!
Get - get up!
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
I am not!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
I'm afraid to let her in the house.
Should I let her in like - ?
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps figures.  [Actual amount taken from craps tables before the skim.] Hey - Hey.
No.
No, Sir.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
I just wanna get out of here.
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
What expenses?
He won't let me in my own house!
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
You just - Just stop him.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey!
All right. Okay, okay.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Leave me alone!
Is that what you did?
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
It's instinctive, you know.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's comin' over.
He's not here?
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Are you sure?
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
Hi, Jennifer.
Hi, how are you?
I can see that. Sure.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Okay.
Thank you.
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Get the fuck out of here.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
He was just on the phone.
He's sittin' by the phone -
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
Yes, don't worry.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
And this is Stacy.
This is Nick.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
They're havin' a good time too.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
No more fuckin' dirty work!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
You're a little confused?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
Hey! Oh!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Hi.
Yes, uh...
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Are you sure?
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Hmm. Not bad.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Selina, are you okay?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
What do you want from me?
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
What a "drag."
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
God-damn..
My, the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Ah, the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
How much?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
You're late.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Who's on the phone?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
Are you guys all right?
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
You missed.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
That's your "rep."
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Where'd they take you to?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Please.
Stop throwing names at me.
What do they need her for?
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
Hey drop it, okay?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
What do you do for a living?
Our house always needs touching up.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
It won't be him.
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Yes?  Yes?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Damned if I know.
At least one.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You, I would've noticed.
You were at the Emerald that night?
Did you hear that?
Any idea where you're going?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
What time frame have you got in mind?
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Negative.
And then?
Yeah?
Who's this?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Who were you talking to?
I'm in awe.
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Saw that one.
He agreed that he was.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
He's still looking, Col.
Good thing in a man.
Ask him.
Thank you.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
You old-fashioned?
Hi.
What's that about?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Piss off, Dave!
As different as it's possible to be.
I think you do.
But you can t stay, you know that?
Did he come here too?
What does that mean?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
How?
Don't.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Come on.
Do you like me even a little bit?
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
So it's true, then?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Your soldier.
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
You killed my Jody?
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Why?
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
Yes.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Do you now.
Did you give him it?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Tough work, that.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Of course. I forgot.
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Dil!
So?
Back in a minute, Jody
And what's she like between the sheets?
This is a farce, man.
I seen your fucking face.
How did you know it was her?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
I'm not a gambling man.
No, what's the funny thing?
C'mere.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Can't. Once I signed up.
Never.
Oh, yeah.
She can't help it.
You liked her?
Don't know her.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
Don't.
When I was a child...
Nothing.
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
You stupid bastard --
I never know nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
It was fun while it lasted.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
What are you talking about?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
But I didn't kill anybody.
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
Reggie -- listen to me!
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Ours.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Bartholomew?
Starting with his own.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
What now?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Sure.
Why can't you be serious?
What are you doing?
Who told you to do that?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I think Tex did it.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Are you going to listen?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
The money is unimportant.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Please keep it.
That was a dumb move, Herman -- a dumb move.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
Where did he keep his money?
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Peter Joshua.
Good for you.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What was all that?
I don't think I follow you.
Who said?
We're here.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
But why do you want a divorce?
He knows everything.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Shoot no, not after all these years.
Why?
Good.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
Ok.
It was a she.
Who is she Daddy?
You found her?
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No, you couldn't.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
Then you should go.
You're the killed.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?
Mark Shale.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
No!
I promised I'd go right home after school.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
You heard about that?
I heard you got attacked.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
What are you doing?
Hi mom.
Mom?
I need to ask you something.
What?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Where are you going?
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
Who?
Yeah.
What?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
That wasn't me ...
Stacy?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
At least somebody likes this shit.

...and fair...
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
What did I say?
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
All right.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
Damn.
Damn diesel injections are flood-...
...town. 
We're clear.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, no, no.
You stole this truck!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
Take your gun!
...work!  It's not even load-...

...I believe in live and...
Oh, shit.
Fuck! 
...Shift.


Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
...wanna give it a try!
What the fuck was that?!

No.  Shit.
 Okay.  Okay. 
 Aw, shit  
...you're dealin' with!
You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Keep still.


Okay.

I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
 Whoo!
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Yeah.
A-And you  owe me...

Ow!  
Listen, Arlo.
They're takin' off.
Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.

Arlo!  Arlo.
Oh.


...-natic.
Whoo!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
All right 

...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They'll meet you at the top.

You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.
Stop limpin' around like that.
You did help a little.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
 Yeah.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?

Vaughn.
Yeah, that's my truck.
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
You got a prob-...
Listen, deputy.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
Colonel Vitelli.  We got a busted-in cold vault inside.
Doc-...
...-lar.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
No!
You look fit...healthy...
...that.
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Hm.  The wind's northwest.  That oughta be...Seattle.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Vaughn.
There.
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Richard Long.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
And don't give him any ice cream...
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, no?
It's after five...
Rangers.
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...without caution...
...fishin'.
Dr.  Long!
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
Lying? 
...to talk, son.
I said let me see your hands now!
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...stole a truck under arrest.


Do it now.
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
An honest living.
Sir?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Lou Escobar \96 he's a Lieutenant.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
Avocado groves?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
How much are you worth?
I want to know what you're worth. Over ten million?
Hello.
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Sure thing.
So there's this fella who's tired of screwing his wife.
Then what'll you do?
Why?
Hello, Jake.
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I want those photographs, Gittes. We're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. Minimum.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
I got your check in the mall.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Mr. Gittes.
How did it happen?
You sure shout that?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
As little as possible.
...No. Why was it.
What about it?
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
Where are you going?
I saw him.
What did he say?  What did he say?
Okay, give me the keys.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
That's good. Now what's her name?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...where does Kyo live?
Let me handle that.
Hello, Miss Sessions. I don't believe we've had the pleasure.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Yeah, Sophie.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Gittes?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
No, really?
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
Then go home and forget about it.
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Mr. Mulwray, please.
How did they get it away from him?
Apple core?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
So he says you sent them?
What's that, pal?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
Neither do I.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Course, she settled down nicely.
What are you doing here?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid.  And why are you telling fibs?  We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre...  How much did you have?
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Elena!...But when...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Sure, sure.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Well, he'll be coming back in September. The Majestic.  I got the reservations. It gets in on the ninth.
What's happened?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
I know that, Emily -
I know it is, Brad -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Get out, both of you!
Thanks.
A rooster?
Is that what you want to do?
Yes -
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
Why not?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I'll sign those papers -
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes and no.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Who told you you could sit down here?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
Are you sure?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
What's this?
Well, if it's already too late...
Thanks. Have a good one.
That's it, everybody out.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
God, isn't he great?
Can I use the bathroom?
Am I missing something here?
Train. It took eight hours.
I'm giving him his ring back.
I just told you.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
Look how full of yourself you are.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
Then who operated the store?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Who are you to make assessments?
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
Pack of cigarettes.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
You open?
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
What smells like shoe polish?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
You win.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Allan Harris.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
The Emperor.
How do you mean?
It would stand to reason, yes.
The quest isn't going well?
There aren't.
Which ones?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Helluva game!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
You know what Sanford told me? 
How? When?
I'm gonna go to her wake.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
Shut the hell up.
No!
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Fine. Just lend me your car.
We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
Holy shit. That girl?
What did she say?
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
You didn't have to choke me.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You know him?
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Oh for God's sake!
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
What?
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
You used to go out with her?
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
How much money did you leave up there?
I was kidding.
"Be there?"
Oh, you think so?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
How many girls have you slept with?
Three?
Who?
All right. Name it.
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
You sucked his dick!
HOW MANY?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
What is it?
You had to tell him.
A couple...?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Check this out, he's from Russia.
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
He really wants to play metal?
Come on, man, "Berserker!"
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
To an Asian design major.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
And... he told you all of this?
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Jessie, girl this is insane. Weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
A monkey?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
She's losing it!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
What are we going to do?
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Do you see them yet?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
The winds are picking up.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
Did I miss something?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
Where?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Gabe!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
What about you?!
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
On top of the peak.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
What the hell are you doing--
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Man against nature, right Travers.
He's alive!
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
You got what we need?
No names, this is an open line!
Rich...
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
What did you do that for?
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Good evening, sir.
Yes. They want to help.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that.
Are you referring to the background score?
How are you feeling today?
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
I hope so. Is that the end then?
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before. Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Moloko-plus.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
Sixth is faster.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
Like what?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
You need a vacation.
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
Where are you, what floor?
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
No.
One more thing.  If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?
I picked up a tail.
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
I brought you flowers.
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
Yeah?  So?
Hello?
How long you think this'll take?
First time in New York?
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
How about the thingy next to it?
Try some deep breathing.
What are you doing?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Who's that?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
What the fuck was <u>that?</u>
What, no insurance?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Vincent.  Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed.
Paid sick leave?
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
There you go...!
And you believe me...?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
What happened?
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
She must be some girl.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
I better get going.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
So what's the question?
Please put it down.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
At a horse show.
Then tell me what happened.
Love at first sight?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Blue moon...
Blue moon...
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
You made your decision yet?
Can I ask you something?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Night after that?
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Which way did he go?
I want to believe you, too.
That you come with me.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
There's no plug to pull.
Dr. Arroway --
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
What is it?  What's happened?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What's the status of the decryption effort?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
What?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
Can't we get rid of them?
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Could we hear God?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Am I one... or many?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
What kind of deal?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
Hokkaido Island.
I'd say this is slightly different.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V.L.A.?
But what about your research -- ?
You sonofabitch.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
I flinched.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one.  How did you do it?  How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
What...?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Hi.
But --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
You don't take another man's place, boy.
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Whatcha got?
But there's still daylight left.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
Where'd the road go?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke. Where you goin?
That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
Cuter again.
I gotta believe. Out!  Now they're rollin'.  King-five-four gets an eight.  Pair'a nines with a Jack gets a four. Ninas still up.
Man Oh Man.
But -- but --
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Now look what you did.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Yes.  Without question.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
Would you want to work with us on this?
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Ruben.
There were needle marks.  But no drugs in her blood.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Just get out of your vehicle...
I like women like that!
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Sergeant?
We could use a little help.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
How'd you get in on the deal?
Detective Niccoletti?
Not a lot of action here.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Can you drive?
What is it?
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
What do you think of this one?
Really?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
You're slowing.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Oh no.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I haven't had a crush since I was
Must you walk so quickly?
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
I'm really not that hungry.
You can only do what feels best to you now.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
Don't take it personally.
Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
What have you done with the ring?
Guess.
For a price.
I wish I could have seen that.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Michael.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Something like that.
I guess we need to talk.
I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
Can I put these here for tonight?
You don't have a fever.
But what about that math project?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
No, you've done a perfect job.
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Hello?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Hello?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Why are you here?
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Uh, no --
But you were there?
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
And for my help I would get what?
I only have your word for that.
I don't know.
For what?
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Because you're the closest.
Turn on the flashlight.
I thought they came with batteries.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
All right, knock it off.
Anybody hungry?
What?
I'm from Belgium.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Hey boss, it's not a science.
They were all French guys.
Yeah, French guys from France.
What room number?
There has to be.
What do we do?
They don't have a wine list.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
No.   How much?
Going somewhere?
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
How's my brother?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
The money isn't here.
I can't even hear myself think.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
When do we go?
You ever hear of jet lag?
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
You got it in a bar?
Can't sleep?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
What are you doing?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
And if I use them to kill you?
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Please.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Give it back!
Lo?
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I don't take orders from anyone.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Out here, you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly, your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
I don't know...
But the sword could be in his compound.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
And you're gonna tell me who.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
They couldn't do anything for me.
Don't interfere.
Mom --?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
At least it finally stopped raining.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Mister Funboy.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
What's goin' on, Elly?
Do you know what you destroyed?
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Top Dollar.
How the hell did you do that?
Neither.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Don't waste my time.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right?  Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a --
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
You heard me.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Romantic? He rapes her.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I sincerely doubt it.
I never said that.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
You're naked.
How are you today?
It was fine.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I'm... I'm alright.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
I don't.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
You know what? I don't take it back.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
But you knew this was important to me.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
See that wasn't so bad.
That was cool.
Does your mother know?
Why didn't you do something?
He made you give him a blow job.
Am I suppose to be this sore?
You think?
Want a blow job?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Whoa!
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Positive.
She bought it.
One.
Hello.
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Tell me all the details.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
Why so nervous?
I thought we should celebrate.
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
You're too kind.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Ronald? That's crazy.
What do you want?
Right after we played backgammon.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
What time is it?
Did she show up?
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
What song, dear?
Did you ever make a wish?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Where'd you get this, darling?
Irena.
I know that.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Something's haywire,
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
But I told her to go with you.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
Merry Christmas.
May I pet the deer?
But why?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me \97 always!
Mommy read it to ne.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
What?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
On the dark nights \97 on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
You'd better hurry.  I've left Amy in the car and she's getting impatient.  She tells me there's something especially important about a sixth birthday.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
He's a very talented musician.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Where are all the mediums?
I think she broke the skin.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Where?
Hey, did you get contacts?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I wonder if he's married.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
So where's this infamous arm now?
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
DON'T call the police.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
You expecting someone?
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
You're such a good friend.
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
What choice do we have?
I'm cleaning my stove.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
What?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
You don't have to pee.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Wow.
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
It's stupid.
My mom used to get PMS too.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
What are they for?
I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left...
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
I think I'm a werewolf.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to do?
See he was cheating from the get go.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
He was found a few blocks away.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
He means the last that we know of.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Sell maps?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
Police.  Nobody move.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
Please, they'll kill me...
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I\EDm your new assistant.
Where do you think this goes?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Such a joker!  Like your father.
You see it?
No.  I, ah...
Water?
Bad dreams?
You've been working too hard.
What happened to you?
What the hell is this?
That shelter was in this bill.
.. Nothing.
... what?
Oh... I'm fired?
Till what?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Uh, let me get back to you...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Three years.
What do you mean by that?
They could put you in jail.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Will he be alright?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Dave...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
Something like what...
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
You're not?
I was waiting for that jack.
What's that?
You're kidding.
Who?
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
... . Ellen.
Oh... Yeah.
That was quite a thing you did today.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
So what do you do the rest of the time?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
It was okay?
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
So this is it?
The Monroe?
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Please....shoot me.
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
How long do we have to watch him?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
What'dya tell that soldier, soldier? You tell him we was rebels?
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
NOOOOOOOOO!
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
You can't run away from the planet, Miss Science. You can't even run away from the island, heh heh.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Mary.
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
You know how many demerits we're talking?
Charlie Dalton.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
God, I can't take it anymore!  If I don't have Chris, I'll kill myself.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
Oh God, it's over now!
Yeah?  Like what?
You know what really excites me about you?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Who else was involved in this?
Hey, he's your roommate.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Pleased to meet you.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Well, sure!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
But I love you.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
Yes sir.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Again!  Louder!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
You really think I should forget her?
I certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  It's just a bunch of people trying to impress Nolan.
But father, I'm assistant editor.
Father!
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is it then?
What?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
And now he will?
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You the Captain?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
And no questions asked.
We were talking about my schedule...
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Noooo!
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
...Jagger was here...I was here...
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...it's okay...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Or maybe not.
Where are you going?
Why don't you back off?
What the hell does that mean?
Someone's back there.
Check it out!
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Fucking women, man...
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Who's full of shit?
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Tell him, Vince!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
He's real bad, Nick.
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You are his friend.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Vince. Hey, you guys --
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
Linda, what's the matter?
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Okay.
What kind of beer would you like?
But --
Nick?
What are you doing?
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
That way it sets.
Fucking A.
What do you think about?
I'll tell you something, Nick. I wouldn't hunt with anyone but you. I won't hunt with a yo-yo.
Is he from here?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Great. That's great.
See you Monday.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
Great. Hey. That's great.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Did you get one?
Didn't I ever tell you about Phantom Mary?
No!
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Up a little there... What would you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Yeah?
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Who is it?
I want to ask you a few questions.
Funny guy.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I'm not on the force anymore.
Mug sheets.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
I want to stop aging.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Just got the call.  Took him from school.  Bastard nailed the Vice- Principal and a teacher.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Sir, your limo's here.
You my partner?
I drive.
Does it drive itself, too?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Married?
What's this place?
You need anything else?
Good night, Wade.
What's this?
You treat her nice.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
You be careful.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
But he was such a good cop.
Seat's too high.
Yes.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Say ... about the interest ...
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Jabez -- will you join our Grange now?
She couldn't be gone!
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Mornin', Jabez ...
Where's everybody?
Where did it come from?
No, no! Give it to me!
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Why of course --
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
Jabez -- help!
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Well -- what are we going to do?
Mary -- it's gone.
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Mary--
You'll never change -- will you?
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary --
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Helps sometimes to say it.
Do you really think that?
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
I want you to fix these fish!
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
It is.
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
I want someone to talk to ...
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
You're all right, Argyle.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection.
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
New York...
How long?
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
I...have a request.
Go on.
After all your posturing, all your speeches...you're nothing but a common thief.
Well, Cappy Roberts retired out here a couple years ago.  He said I could bunk with him.
...I've missed you.						*
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
'Roy'.
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What's going on?
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Gene -- you smilin'?
So whatsa deal?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Hey, don't take the car!
Yeah...
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I gotta listen to it if they think...
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Who's this?
You alone, or you got confederates?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
You frisk me.
Okay, give us the women.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
He wanted to kill me!
What the fuck do you want?
Yeah ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
We're all set at Kennedy.
I must of been outta my mind.
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
The gun's right on your back...
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
What if I take you with me?
Where's the air conditioning?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
No you don't.
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
Mister Mulvaney?
You got Bank Americard?
Thanks again, Sam.
I didn't eat any pizza.
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
He's gone?
To show that we're negotiating.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

Sonny -
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Bullshit!
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
What's wrong?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
I don't want him.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
This is Bishop.
I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Okay.
I've already formulated a plan.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.
So who is this <i>Choko?</i> Is he your new boyfriend?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
God help us. God help us all.
Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
What the... <i>who is this bitch?</i> <b> EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT </b> Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand... threatening them.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.

Fast and or furious.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Mookie.
You the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
Make it plain.
How long?
No!
Squash it.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Sal's gonna be mad.
No.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
And move to Long Island.  Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire.  Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got.  I'm too through with yar people.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
It's dug.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Mookie, what took you so long?  I got a business to run.
Whatdafuck do you want?
How much?  How much do I owe you?
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Later for you.
Feels good.
Be a man.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
Smack him back.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
That's what you think?
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
How do you know this?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Hey!  Watch it.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
C'mere.  Don't get too friendly with da Mook.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
Hey guys.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
What are you wearing?
Okay.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
I think it's just over there.
No, it's a treasure map.
No no no no no.
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
H A R R Y...
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Whoa. What was that?
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
HARRY.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
Owww... refreshing.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Sure I do. On one condition.
But-
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
A raft.
If you have to ask, you don't know.
Cute puppy.
I... found that rock.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Ready Lloyd?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
The one on the left.
She's one of a kind.
So can I come along?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
Hey, Turk rescued you from the nerd. You're in!
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
What are you doing here?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
What are you doing?
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Sure.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Mrs. D! I was hoping you'd show up.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Times two.
It's a surprise.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon, Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
As the legend says.
Don't touch my mother...
Remove her gag!
A million deaths are not enough for Yueh...
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Run!
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Will we see a worm?
Spice!... pure un-refined spice!
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
THE PAIN!
Pain by nerve induction... A human can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
No.  I don't work here.
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Bela, are you ready?
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why are you here??
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
What do you think you're doin'?!
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Goddamn landlord.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
So my associate Mr. Marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
I kinda need it now.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Really?!  Well good for you.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Mr. Reynolds!
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
What is happening?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
OUR picture?
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed, and starred in it just like Orson Welles in "Citizen Kane"!
Hello.
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Oh.  Okay.
Stop!
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
You know, to make the legs move --
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
I thought this was a group effort.
B-but it's our money --
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
What the heck is THIS?!!
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
What?!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Did you see that?
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
You know what would be great?
Yeah only I wish they had the sister on more.
Ed, can I see you a second.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Yeah.
I don't think so.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Al!
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
So he killed himself.
Send him away.
No.
How's Marcia? She all right?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
I can't believe you're taking his side.
Eddie...
Who?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Hi, Mom. 
She won't.
What are you doing?
What does this mean?
How much less?
I batted!
So?
You do though, you look great.
Ha!
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Um...
Page three of the Post.
There's a list.
I'm sorry.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
Why do you do that?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
All right.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Who is it?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Why me?
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
No -- keep it.
That girl's an idiot.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Sign here, please.
By the X.
But you haven't written your novel.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
How'd it go?
You're kidding, right?
Mr. M.?
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Plenty of pep, too.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
And how did you get in the school?
points at the motel.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Yep.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
And she's super-nice
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where you're going.
People can see this.
These are private -- these are for us.
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Thought what?
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
Yes, Paul?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Merry Christmas.
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
But you did it anyway.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Look.  I want to see you again.
You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Captain, what do you want?
Yeah, I hate them.
Will you work for me?
How what, Wendell?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
You expecting problems?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Bud...
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Thanks, but no thanks.
No.
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Should I?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Ray, we got the shotguns.
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Something like that.
John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Damnit...
I need to speak to you.
Even I'm not that crazy.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
So what's the point?
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
On what evidence?
It seems like my Susan, but...
You're back, boychick.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Was it a party?
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
It'll be our secret.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Working whores with squad two.
Brill?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
Someone else?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
I'm doing a transfer now.
I'll come straight there.
It is?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You knew the deal. No contact.
Yes.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
Wait. What do I do?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
I mean did you call anyone.
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it.  The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world.  At least it better be.
What do you think?
Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
You're driving.
Goddammit--
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if <u>what</u>?
Baudmore Consultants.
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Is it okay?
How 'bout Christian Dior?
I know, but--
Because my life is being ruined.
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Did he give you anything?
Anything at all?
Was he with anyone?
Why'd you go to Harrison's?
For your wife?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You should take this seriously.
What?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Is Eric in school?
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
What can I do for you?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
And then what?
Brill?
Other than Brill.
Why would I--
What makes you think it's you?
You're a moron, you know that?
Yeah?
You're wrong.
Hey!
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
He's kidding.
Where've you been?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
That's what I want to talk to you about?
Yes.
I don't know!
Yeah?
It's been a few years.
Yeah.
What does that have to do with you?
You think there was a connection to--
There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
What happened?
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
Yes sir.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Thank you.
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
That insults them.
You felt obliged to.
You should come into the shelter.
Don't.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
Dance with me.
It hurts too much.
Don't leave me!
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
A broken car?
Have you seen Katharine?
I see.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Alm\E1sy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
What did you do?
Why do they care about our maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still\85
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but\85  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
David Caravaggio.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Hana?  Hana?  Are you alright?
Where did you find that?
Oh, all over.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Top Hat.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
The team is in mourning, darling.
Oh.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
For my hair?
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
What are you up to?
And what if he really is a spy?
Why Picton?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever\85 you and Lieutenant Singh\85
I've got a surprise.  A boat!  We can go to Capri.  It's got a cabin, it's private.
You've got a mustache.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Certainly not.
Katharine!
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Or my wife's.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
You ordering chop suey again?
Meaning--
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Mr. MacDougal.
Seems I am.
I didn't expect you to be so...
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
What the hell was that?
It's one way.
What about your bags?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
I know it well.
Only a week?
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
I go in alone.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
Aren't we early?
You can't be too careful.
Can you see the other PIRs?
They moved it.
The big job.
Your share.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
What about the rules?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Pulse detectors.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Four billion dollars.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
--You're a cop.
He looks familiar.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
In the van.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Right.
You look like George Washington.
She's calling the shots now.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
What the hell is this doing here?
There's more than one?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Five million dollars?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does.  Send in a r\C8sum\C8, make an --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
All I have is hundreds.
You're a girl.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Okay, enough --  Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf.  Find you something else, okay?
What are you doing here?
What medical records?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
And you can't?
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
I like this case.
I want my fucking money --
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Fuck Kurt.
I was wrong.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Two million dollars?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
What kind of chromium is it?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Can I play roller hockey?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --
You want my number?
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Cause I don't even know you.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What're you doing?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
You already packed up your stuff?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Hello?
They up?
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Where's my paycheck?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
There's something else, too.
You're moving away?  When?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
He will learn patience.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks a blue streak.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks his concern.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his consternation.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Yes sir!
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
You, too, golden rod.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I don't know what he's talking about.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Easy, your worship.  Only trying to help.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What are you staring at?
Has Threepio turned up yet?
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
About what?
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
Are you kidding?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
I'll take what's mine now.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
We've got to find Luke.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
You don't have to do this to impress me.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Jabba the Hutt?
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
I can't. It's too big.
I don't believe it.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Yes, My Lord.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Good God.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
Do you have a name?
Nobody's going to believe it.
What, Lewis?
Go easy, Stevie.
Humans?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Where is he?
Give it to me.
I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
Shut up, Plissken.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
75% power.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Location.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
How do you know all this?
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?  Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
The freeway.
Is he coming?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Yield. I have the advantage.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
But your life and lands are far from here.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Arthur.
What book is that?
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
But, I'm here.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
There are things about love--
Very well. Climb up.
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
No, he's working on another book.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
It's-
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Hi
Here.
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
What's Burke got to do with it?
I'm gonna miss you.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
Oh, she'd love it.
No. No rats.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
There is nothing.
A man to see you.
Is it coming out Willie?
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
About my daughter?
He didn't mention?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Did you know my mother died recently?
Where's Regan's father?
What kind of stuff?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
Where?
You know how?
Captain who?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
I don't want it.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Karras.
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get it then?
Goodnight Dims.
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
Your mother's in here with us Karras, would you like to leave a message? I'll see that she gets it.
Did you do that?
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
What's that?
I'm all right.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let the enemy have no power over her.
Amen.
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Hey, Father? You like movies?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
...Be gone!!
Is there someone inside you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys!
What's this?
What about tomorrow?
Twelve years.
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Trunks?
Well, look at this.
Honey ...
What's wrong with them?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
You the magician?
My brother and I. One each.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
What's the gig?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
Don't make trouble, all right?
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
So we on tomorrow night?
What d'ya got?,
What do you think?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
This time you gotta go.
Your older brother.
Yeah?
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So you'll come out, right?
A gust of wind killed him.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
Get out of here!
Something, huh?  All those bids.
You all right?
Just a lucky guess.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Unless you want the right.
All night?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
How dare you say you love me.
Couple years.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What're you doing?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What?
Uh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there. If you want to get started.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
So what'd you think?
So she's got a few sniffles.
You got no right springing this on me, Frankie. It's unethical.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
What do you mean?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
I sing now?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
What-?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
That!  You can't wear that!
Nine!
What do you think?
Shoes?
They're tight.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Hey, we're connected.
Peggy Lee?
What'd she sing?
Got another song for us?
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
Is that important?
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
Brought it.
You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
You never sang before?
He takes after our mother.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Forget it.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Can't sleep?
You were good.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Yeah.
Jack.
Yeah.
Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
You mean if I get sick?
Fine work, Jon.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Why would he need more?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
... I was dreaming ...
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Whoever you are, don't call again.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
How's Loomis?
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
Which ear was it?
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
Jamie ...
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
You've got someone in your office.
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
Commander, what are you doing here?
You merciless bastard!
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
-- what?
... That's great.
What are you doing?
-- Yes.
Kate Reynolds...
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Hello?
Why Jack?
Mr. Mintz.
You have kids, Jack?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Mom, don\92t you think we need to open the presents?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
What am I saying?  You don\92t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that\92s all.  Is that you?
She is relentless.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You\92re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
So Jack, it\92s your wife\92s birthday, got anything to say to her?
How\92d you know my name?
Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it\92ll be returned!
Got a minute, Jack?
Yeah?  What do you need?
It\92s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
That\92s it?  That\92s all I get?!  A glare?!
I\92ve got kids, I\92m going home...
Like the dress...?
Finger food...?
Something like that.
Are we...?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Mr. Mintz?  I don\92t think so...building\92s closed pal.  You\92ll have to come back tomorrow.
I don\92t care who you are.  It\92s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Why don\92t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Don\92t  go, Jack...
Right, for us. But...I\92m afraid that if you get on that plane...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Look, we don\92t have time for this right now, we\92ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You\92re not wearing that to the Thompsons\92 party. I don\92t care how hilarious you think it is...
You look forward to this party all year.  What\92s with you today?
What are you doing?
Yes, I\92m fine.  It\92s just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Wait a second.  You want me, don\92t you?
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
It\92s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Well...Annie for one.
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would\92ve happened if you hadn\92t stepped in at the store.
You want the cake!?
Maybe I should wait...
Here\92s the thing.  I really hadn\92t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary\92s good all day...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I don\92t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
Are you out of your mind?
I'm sorry...
So you\92re not at a non- profit firm?
You can\92t go!
Please. Let\92s just go have a cup of coffee. That\92s all I\92m asking for. I\92m sure there\92s another flight to Paris tonight.
Don\92t do this, Jack... But he continues...
I need you, tiger..
For the money, they\92re hands down the best radial we carry...
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I mean...
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Those yours too?
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Are you alright?
Ben --
Time for <u>your</u> lesson, Vic.  Chem 101: what happens when you <u>supercool</u> hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Where...where am I?
What's wrong with me?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
I'll be watching over you.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
You look like an eighties rock band.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Oh, you dawg you.  Better not be my nurse!
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Back it down, Johnny!
And where do we think we're going?
You're hot!
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Apparently I can disappear.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
What are you doing --
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
For science.
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
Remember our first date here...?  God, I was so nervous.
When I walked out, I waited <u>ten</u> <u>minutes</u> outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Please don't make this personal --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What is it?
What're you getting at?
Benes... What the devil happened?
How bad off is he?
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Difficult? He's impossible!
Listen...the Heart.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Only to the naked eye.  Those corpuscles -- carrying oxygen -- give the stream its color. But the rest of the plasma's very much like sea water. An ocean of life...
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
There it is!
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
You have no right to blame Duval --
Looks like quite a way to go...
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Atomic fuel?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
What is it, Skipper?
Yes, there is.
How's it look?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
The Wall's transparent...
...What do you mean, you decided not to park here?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
One of us pays the other for half.
Huh?
Well, okay, it's -
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Any others?
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
You're not a C student.
You know what a disparity is?
Good to see ya again, Jerry. If these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
...Yah, okay...
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Yeah, but -
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
but do you know that for sure without -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Are you calling Stan?
Norstars.
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Yah.
Stan and I're okay.
We're good to loan in.
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
No, see -
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Carl somethin'?
Where is everybody?
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, that's a good one.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Better times.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Yep.
Nope.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
Whose car?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Your mallard?
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
Oh, my.
The first rule of Project --
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
Cornelius!  How are you?
We need to talk.
And I saw you practicing this...
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
I found a new one.
You feel nothing?
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
What is this?  Who did this?
Yeah?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What did you say... ?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
You got about thirty seconds.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Let go of me!
Tyler...
Who did this to you?
Hello?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
Well, I have to file a claim...
I don't follow...
No, I...
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
A nice, big cock.
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Okay... Ghandi.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
What?
Huh?
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.
... Marla ... ?
What are we doing?
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
You're too young.  Sorry.
Four in Milwaukee.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
...stop me?
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
If I'm wrong, we're both dead..
I'm pulling the green wire.
Tyler...
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Appreciate something.
Who is this?
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
I... I don't know...
Animals.
Would you rather be dead?
What list?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
You have to tell us now.
Please, what else could it mean?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Kalarjian?
What is it?  What are you?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
Can I ask you a question?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
Mom?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
That... him?
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
Remember the departure time?
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Carter, get out!
You know what to do.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
SHUT UP, BILLY!
You read me, Brewer?
Batteries not included.
We'll check it out.
What's that?
You better take off.
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Are you okay?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
What was that?
What's the job?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
Typical...
How long have you been setting up?
You think they'll find any?
Black.  No sugar.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Who're you?
What's your name?
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
This your stuff?
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
Will it hurt?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
My parents were divorced.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
What?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts... 
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Can I have my desk please.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
Hello....congratulations.
What are you two up to?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
.....Me neither.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Yes.
Which ones?
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Please don't hurt me?
Have I died?
What's her name?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
SAW WHO!!?
Parry...
.....What are you doing?
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Are there any questions?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Beautiful night huh?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Well, it's enough for me.
What are we about to do?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Now, now.
Is it my turn again?
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I know you're not.
"Every trail that you blaze/Makes me..."
What?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Sure...
Rayette.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
What's your name?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Can I get you anything else?
No substitutions.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
You want me to hold the chicken.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Oh.
No.
Yeah... I guess so...
Maybe you better stay, then.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Do you want some gingerbread?
Where is she, anyway?
It's none of your business!
Why?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
What?
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
I have to talk to you.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
What kind of doggy is that?
I don't think that's true.
You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
You better hold onto your tongue!
Mass production is what does it.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Miss Dupea.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Wussup?
So watcha doin'?
Come down!
Eddie from Compost?
Where you goin'?
I gotta go take a piss.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
You looking for somebody?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Where you know Amanda from?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
Maybe tonight?
Wonder who his supplier is.
Fletch!
Fletch F. Fletch
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Two bs?
No children?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Like when?
What, the heat here?
You gonna nail the chief?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Here you are, Doctor.
Are you serious?
Cash. I'm impressed.
Good evening.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Right.
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch.
It\92s okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I'm still here.
A .357.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
His bride. Cute as a button.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception?
I bet you do.
Alan's in Utah.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
Lunch...
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Can I ask you a question?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
Who.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
What are you talking about?
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
I was afraid you'd say that.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
You can't do that.
Don't worry, I can take it.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
No wonder.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Where is she?
Tell the cops.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Fletch, you want an apology?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
Now that we've broken the ice...
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
So many assholes, so few bullets.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
You going to be okay?
Why did you interrupt?  Maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
Hello, Ford...
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Aha, just what I suspected!
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Hello?
You okay?
Let's get serious...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
My axe!
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Ouch.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
I tried to help you...!
Yeah, go on...
It's me.
The point?
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
It doesn't have to be like this?
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You're that guy, the private eye.
Hi, private eye guy!
What?
B.O.C.A.
What?
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Comment va-t-elle?
Le sommes nous?
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
It's beautiful.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Des Moines.
Yeah!
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
No sir -- this is where Joel lives.
What happened to you?
You want the red or the white?
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
What are you saying?
You got a collar in here for the Nightingale murders?
They around?
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
Gotta be another way up, Frank.
How about a little of the King?
I love you, Bud.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
You ready?
What?
Sorry 'bout that.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
Oh my god.
That's impossible.
No wait, don't go!
What?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
John, you still there?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Please, Dad, just do it.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
Hey, OK if Gordy uses your old gear?
I better give you my address then.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
Got a minute?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Are you a good cop, John?
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
Wife around?
I look familiar?
No kiddin'?
Huh.
Who are you?
... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this?
Breakfast?
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
Think you can figure it out?
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
I'm a slow eater.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
And, what about us?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
In that little thing?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
See anything?
Bullseye!
I thought that was the end of the song.
What?
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
What it is?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
It's all over.
Lake Forest Green?
That's debatable.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Yes!
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
I know who you are.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jason Voorhees is dead.
What do you want?
What's the problem here?
Good night, beautiful.
Does he know about what happened?
It was a community service.
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Randy, c'mon!
Well?
How many times do you want to hear this?
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
No thanks.
Time to check out the waiters.
What murders?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
I...I can't...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I've got the numbers.
Rennie...
I heard you weren't coming.
I didn't mean for you to go!
We must abandon.
Don't talk like that.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
We must abandon.
It's just a review.
And he was there?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
We're making too much of this.
Had to be him.
This could be it.
This could be it.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
What will we talk about?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
What do we want?
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
What else?
See, Daddy.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Life is good.
Who is it?
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
You're charming the boy.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
Because life is good.
They're my team.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
I hate the Mets.
Have to hurry back.
Game six is history,pal.
Yessiree, Bob.
Mine was cobalt blue.
Yes.
You've worked with Elliot?
And he has finer moments now and then.
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
Yes.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
Just an admirer...
That was lucky.
You mean Gandhi?
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
What can we do?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Will you have a glass of sherry?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
How are you doing this, Vincent?  How have you done <i>any</i> of this?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I'm sorry, there's no way we can.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
From what budget?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
What's wrong with it?
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
You wish.
It's all right.
You really had other offers?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
How was your evening?
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
What will happen to the others?
Vincent...Vincent...
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
Why don't we say we were together?
Does it have a name?
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What about the car?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Feel good?
Where did you get those?
That's not all of it.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's just been a while.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
I didn't. I just waited.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
You know how I feel?
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
Doc...
They checked in.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Why didn't you tell me?
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
We better stick here till tonight.
No more about Beynon.
So what?
You're crazy.
Come on, come on.
That's right.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Hope you get to where you're going.
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Can I help you?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Two.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
That's what I want.
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I got a nurse in mind.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
You knew what I'd do.
What's it got to do with you?
How'd it happen, then?
I made a mistake.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Can I go now?
Everyhing go off all right?
What about?
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
How were things between you and Frank?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
And what was that?
Is he coming here?
That's why you waited for me.
I want to give you an Oscar.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Have another?
Sorry about your father.
Oh, what you doing now?
Where you going to live, then?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Don't know.
How'd you know Albert?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Did they give you a rough time?
Will this do?
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
I'll call the police.
They bloody hurt me.
They're friends of mine.
Is he?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Meaning what?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, you've been watching television.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Jack! I didn't like that.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Ask me?
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
We're stuck with this...
It is.
It's too...
I...
...that's right...
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
Just the act.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Somebody...
Yes.
We're just "talking" about it.
Did I say that?
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Yes.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Oh, yes, George.
Me?
Why?
Do you need five grand?
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
Yes.
A waste of time?  Why?
The cops?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Yes.
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse...
Did they...?
Did they catch...?
Did the leads come in yet?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
That's great.
Shelly: get in the office.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Who told you...?
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
Why?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
I'm not sure I have two.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
No.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
Is that what you're saying?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Excuse me...
Five thousand.  I kept half.
It was his idea.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
What sales...?  I just closed eighty-two grand...Are you fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this is only the beginning.
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Dave...
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
"Always be closing..."
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
What?
Rick...
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Ricky, I...
Yes.
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
Monday.
Who did she call?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
What's going on here?
She wants her money back.
I can't regotiate.
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
What...?  Say the words.
What power?
The deal.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
You cashed the check?
Fuckin' asshole.
Fuck you.
Listen to me: They got some of them.
Yes.
I have the stuff from last year's...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Yes.
Did you like your party?
On your pillow.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Yes, thank you.
Goddamn bitch.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After all these years, why'd you turn against him?
We were all upset about that.
Mikey, why would they ever hit poor old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember when he was just a 'button,' when we were kids.  We used to put bedsheets on our heads, you know, like we were ghosts.  An' ole Frankie come peek into our room, we'd jump up, and he'd always pretend like he was really scared. You remember?
No.  I mean, are you sure?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
He said there was something good in it for me...me on my own.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
The 'patrone' is here.
He's not the same as when I met him.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Me too, Tom?
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
They are everywhere!
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
You're right.
What the hell are you talking about?
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
And what's the price of their not finding out.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Whose orders are these?
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
Does it feel like a boy?
His brother came to help him.
That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in the old days... there was only one legitimate reason to kill a blood relative... only one.  IF he was a traitor.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Are you Klingman?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
There are still things I have to do.
Enjoy.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Says who?
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
I know.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I'm talking about Italians!
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
So what did you think?
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Something I can do for you?
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You did not know?
It's not what you think.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
What have you done with him?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
These are your paintings?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch.
Do you mind?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
I liked it.  We all did.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
What way might that be?
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
Very well put.
Ah.  A philosopher.
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Is that really her?
Are you enjoying yourself?
It's not like her.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Do you mind?
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Did I hurt you?
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
What are you doing here?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Jimmy.  How are you?
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
Oh, that monster.  How could you be working with him?
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
This is the studio where I paint.
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
You're serious.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
You didn't?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Yeah -- ?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
They gave you only four days?
I'm not interested --
Sound it out for me.
Get out --
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Well, that certainly won't do.
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
How's that?
You have my word...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Who is it -- ?
Okay, then. I'll catch you later, Randall ...
How'd it go?
It just ain't happening --
okay ...
Got it ...
What's the matter?
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
How you know that?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
Have you seen him?
He's in some trouble ...
You getting my checks ... ?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
I know...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
You goin' home?
Sure -
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
Hey, Kip ...
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
He's gonna kill you -- !
You can handle it?
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
You boost her -- ?
You okay -- ?
You want me to buy her?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
I left town. I didn't leave you.
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
She's trouble --
I go with you --
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No ... ?
Ready -- ?
I do ... I cut "em...
Now... I'm in ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
You okay -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
Is he still working here ?
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
What about me?
You know what you got here?
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
I warned you a million times.
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
What're you doing? What about the car?
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What'll I tell Fran?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I want to talk to Jimmy.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
You know what to do?
I gotta go home.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!
I hate to do dishes.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You want a partner?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
She's sharp as a marble.
She didn't do it again did she?
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Who'd you call?
What?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
What class?
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
Is that true?
Holy shit.
Chuck, let's go.
I'm not sure--
I don't think I...Larry?
What class did you say that was?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Codebreaking.
Where is it touching you?
No, there's a limit.
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
No.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Can we do it at my office?
Why would he do that?
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
I could go for a Whopper.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
You're right. I know.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Probably not.
Yeah, I read those.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Yes, I do.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
I been there. I played my hand.
Yes.
I know.
I know.
You suck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
You grew up around here?
I bet you have a great family.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
Why do we always stay here?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
When?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I know. I just do.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Twicet now I've fell for that line. Maybe he needs a thousan' men. So he get's five thousan' there, an' he'll pay fifteen cents a hour. An' you guys'll have to take it 'cause you'll be hungry.  'F he wants to hire men, let him write it out an' say what he's gonna pay. Ast to see his license. He ain't allowed by law to contrack men without a license.
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Want to work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Open up! We hear you got a riot.
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
Think she'll hold?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
Lookin' for a job?
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Get to what?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I stay in my own yard.
I never asked you!
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
What's the matter, Grampa?
Where you going?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
How 'bout it?
Know where we're a-goin'?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Yes'm, that was it.
Was Granma bad?
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I ain't full.
They know he got hit in the face.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Sure. Good-by.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
You wouldn't think jus' reachin' up an' pickin'd get you in the back.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Please don't.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
Bob. Bob Destephano.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Never better.
What am I gonna do?
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Are you going to the reunion?
It's always the little things.
Watched television?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
...Let me get my coat.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Is it something you've done?
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
You went to school with these people.
Say more.
You know where I live?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
What do you want?
Hello, Bob.
That's strictly B\E0ader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
They blame you for the compromise.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
Enough?
Don't forget your identity.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
So what happened to you?
Ten years. What happened!?
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
He's beautiful.
Shit.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
How did you meet her?
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
You missed a button.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Would you like to see that?
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Did he tell you that?
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
What did you say?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
How's everything?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What did he say?
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've got to stop doing that?
Why did you go?
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Good night.
Yes?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
It's so cruel.
What was it like?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
What?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
- See, what you can do for him --...
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Ha...
Would you let me ride your horse?
What does she do?
I can't...
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Did you notice -- no cane?
Don't be such a baby!
You're looking fit.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
Let's keep her.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What's that?
Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
Very impressive.
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Ta-da!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Damn!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
I want it to have my children!
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Who's that?
What did we learn in school today?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Crash Override.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
What the hell is going on?
Yeah.
Name your stakes.
Your slave?
Thank you.
Kate, listen.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Shit!!
You look good in a dress.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Gill.
Hello?
Mr. Belford?
Die, dickweeds!
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
What?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Are you two okay?
What's going on?
Is there another key?
Go!
Found it.
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
I do.
I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here.  Michael Myers was his patient.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
What?
Had enough?
Jamie!
We'll hear sirens soon.
That's all the windows, Dad.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
It's been totally charted.
He was standing right here.
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.
Annie, was that you?
What's the pumpkin for?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Yes, you can.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
Is that all you say?
Yeah, sure.
A man wouldn't do that...
You have the wrong feeling.
Exactly what do you need?
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Where?
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
TOTALLY!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Well, she's totally not here.
Are you coming over tonight?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Not any more.
The bogyman!
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Hello.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
...any sister talk?
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though.  It really is.
That's disgusting!
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
You're joking.
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Mm-hm.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
I can't resist.
Is this your first job?
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
And it's just in one ear?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
How about you?
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No!  No...
Yeah.  How are you?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Is something wrong?
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Mm-hm?
She has all the cooking talent.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
It's so late.
I want one with you.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
Are you?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Why should I be afraid?
How about something to eat?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
So you met somebody else?
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Look at this guy.
N-n-no, not that.
But you don't have any symptoms!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Okay.
He's married...
Sometimes she's terrific...
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
Awwww...
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You're too demanding.
Hey, what's the matter?
Well--
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
At least I'm open to new concepts!
God!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Boy...Holly...Holly.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I can't think.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
It wasn't my day.
Yes?
...why?
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
You want to get married...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Why did he come back?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
<u>Do</u> it...
Where was the call from.
I like Popcorn...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
What would <u>that</u> be?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
...unmarked hundreds....
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, \A5our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Look at this:
A fellow with five fingers.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
....I didn't realize I said it out loud.
I'm an orphan.
I said how's your baby...?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
If your duty requires it.
My scar is a war-wound.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
You look lovely.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
...which of us is free...?
The girl needs help.
You want another drink, honey...?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
"Because we don't have any money."
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
Ask me when we get home.
Hello....?
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
...what a lovely perfume.
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
What're they on about?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
...sir...?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
No.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Howdy Pouty.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
Mine!
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Goodnight, Jasper.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
That would be a No.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
So this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Come on Heather. We want another look at today's lunch.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
What's your damage? Brad says you're being a real cooze.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Where did you get these?
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
No way, no day!
Probably....
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
Well then, I'll pray for rain.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Good plan.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
Mute!
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
We killed them, didn't we?
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
How do you turn the fucker off?
The bomb, asshole!
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Let's kick his ass.
You going to eat this?
We on tonight man?
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I got a confession to make. My name used to be Heather, too.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
 Got an A, Mum!
Come on, sit up.
I'm educating myself!

The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
You have it.
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I'm so happy to see you!
That's coming along well!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Hello!
To be known as He!
This.
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go overseas . . .
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Mummy!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
It's inside a moving car.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Skin cancer.
Pitbull attacks.
Sorry.
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
That was cold...
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
What do you want?!
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Are you ready?
-Tawny.
It's not that kind of date.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
He gives a good report and I walk?
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!
My fault!  My fault!  This nut case goes out on a ledge and it's my fault?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Was it you?  In the plane?  Who saved my life?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
It's not right, Gale...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
That too.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
Saving people is not our job.  It's as wrong to step in and save someone as it would be to push someone off.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Where are these toys of yours?
Are you being helped, sir?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Right.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
So you don't have anything concrete?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Where'd he go?
Honey --
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Did you hear what he said?
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
I thought we'd be happy here.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Just reduced.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
How large is your brood?
Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get stupid again!
All right then, if I have to go to school then I'd better go.
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Even better.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Anything from the bank?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
You?
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Sing.
I'm leaving.
Thank you, Thomas.
What are we doing here?
That was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  Would you live that pain again?
Well?
I stood up first.
What do you think?
This cannot be.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
You're hurt.
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
Why do you stare at me like that?
I don't know.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
Good evening.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Why not?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Be careful, Conner.
Someone broke into the cavern last night.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It has to be.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
Call the Palmdale City Attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  When you get the warrant, have Mikkelson and Dreyer search his house.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Talley.
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father, and I hate Sonny, too. Always with the tan.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
I guess not.
The car.  All you want is the car?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
Not if they're looking at something else.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'll give you these people.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
What about my father?
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Donuts here any good?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
I'm scared shitless.
No one's coming.
Want one?
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What do you want?
Where are they?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Louise?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Do it.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Let it go, Captain.
It's right in front of us.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Where are you right now?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Okay.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Where's your gun?
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Paul!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
You want to pay me?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Excuse me, Colonel.
They fired a rocket at us.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
He did.
We are better here.
I committed no war crimes.
Let's go.
Let\92s go, Jock.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Where are we going, sir?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
Can we phone them in, Paul?
This is a Rolex, I can't take it.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Your brother's here?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
You could have asked for a favor.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Go to the roof now.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I have a confession. When we met...
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Rutaganda's place?
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
What do we do with all these people?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Paul. Are you alright?
Out? Where are you going?
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
There are soldiers.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
It's complicated. But don't worry --
Jesus H. Christ!
What are you playing here, Price?
-- I did: down here.
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
This is nuts.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
-- closed.
Thanks.
You hear somebody?
Cheery looking bunch.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
You okay?
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
No...
You think this is fucking funny??
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
Well, I don't.
I'll take my chances.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Problem where? Looked good to me.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
Rewind that.
It works.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
Excuse me?
Price!
Pritchett: what is going on?
-- hey! --
For the love of God....please...?
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
Town records are coming up now.
It will heal.
Where does this amulet come from?
By freeing them.
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Can you talk to her?
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
She's here.
I want this one, daddy.
What's he doing daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
We're here Aubrey!  Look, don't be afraid.  We want you to come back to us...
Mommy!
I wish I knew more about her.
The heater's here.
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
A friend?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
You don't think I know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Are you all right?
What do you mean, unfortunately?
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
You must be a Londrigan.
Well it's nice that you were there for her.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
You must be the new tenants.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
This isn't happening...
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
There's something in there.
There's something through that wall!
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Not on station time.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Uh-huh?
What?
But I don't know anything!  Really.  I just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  He ...
I'll boil some water.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Sure.  Why?
What am I looking for?
Welcome. 38
Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
But you gave me a rose ...
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
I miss you too.
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Really?
That was beautiful.
That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss anything?
"A mule is an animal with long funny ears."
"You could be swinging on a star."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
That was close....
Alex, are you....
What the hell....
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Thanks tough guy, thanks a lot. Why was the guard chasing you?
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
What have you been doing?
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Way to go, Anna.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Bunny, not you too?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
This is the worst night...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
I can't believe this.  I'm in fucking Russia, or do I have to say, the fucking Soviet Union and I'm shooting a non-Bolshevick.  I never thought I'd say "I'm just in this job for the money."  Sad. Any last immature quips?
Snappy.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
A sawbuck!
Ol' satchel-butt...
What a horrible little person.
Cigarette?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Oh, is that it!
...You do?
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Muncie.
I got big ideas, though!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
My pleasure, sir.
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Oh, geez.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Not that way! Through the door!
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She isn't!
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
No.  She was mindless but not like Miss Jessica.  But the Houngan cured her.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I really intended going out to the Fort and meeting you long before this, Miss Connell.  I'm Mrs. Rand -- Wesley's mother.
I'd love to.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Mrs. Rand...
Does she suffer?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
The West Indies?
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Can't I take it for you?
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I wanted to help you.
I told you.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
You wanted to warn me...
You want that?
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
What about her?
That could be a serious accusation, Rand, if it weren't a foolish one.
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Good night.
What do you think?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
What?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Don't start.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Well?
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Hi dad.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Anyone special? You know...
About?
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Talking to me, dad?
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
-- What advice? You never --
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
You okay?
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
How'd you know?
Forget what?
What?
What do you mean?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Just be careful.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Maybe you should have just a half.
Want some gum?
Did you tell Sandy?
You have to follow me?
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to...
Wow!
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Hood residence.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Yeah.
He's dead.
It feels warm.
Didn't want to miss anything.
So far.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I have to get back.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
Who's that?
This murder was in the papers, right?
Who's playing?
Oh, I shouldn't have...
It's legitimate.
He would have liked that.
No.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
We're sure it's hers?
Dormer.  Still no sign of the bullet that went through Farrell.
No.
He's just rattling your cage.
Your friend's all business.
Will...I...
Stuff.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
I told you I don't remember.
How should I know?...
I don't know.
Thought I smelled something.
I don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!
No game.
I'm sorry?
I suppose.
Where's your back-up?
Wild card.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
And perhaps this is the only real evil left...
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
I couldn't prevent it.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You didn't even warm them, did you?
Your melancholy eyes...
I'm not your daughter.
Why always on this night?
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
Don't Louis --
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
It can't be -
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
This is no performance.
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Let's call that a start.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
You really want to be with them?
Did I hear a yes?
You're sure?
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
Have you ever been caught?
Read her thoughts.
You fool, what have you done?
We belong in hell.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
I have to go now Lestat...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved your wife, surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
You found nothing?
Dear God. I've failed again, haven't I?
And the child who did die?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
What can I do for you?
Julie, we're talkin' suites!  That'll be just fine with us.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Listen to me. He's here.
He does work hard.
Karaoke -- perfect.
You get any sleep at all?
Nice move.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
There's no way to lock it.
I'm holding your hand!
Yeah.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
Voodoo.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Julie, is everything cool? Karla said...
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
He leave you?
Where is everybody?
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
We'll only be a second, okay?
Where'd Estes go?
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
We will see who is the first to die.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I hope Mr. Jacks gets to bed in one piece.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer \97\97 a correspondent of some sort \97\97
I felt he did not like me.
What would I be thinking?
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep \97- I want to avoid it.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure \97- quite sure.
What is her illness?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl \97\97
Thea is so like her \97\97 in every feature \97\97
She was beautiful. There was blood between her family and my kin. But that did not stop me from taking her when I saw her beauty, nor did it stop her from loving me.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle \97-
Thea, what's wrong?
Well, tell, him.
Why in the world can't you?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" \97-
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family \96\96 no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there \96\96 he says he's an angel \96\96 he's tried to hypnotize me.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
By letting me help you.
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
You know where he lives?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
A boy?
Who is it?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen \96\96 that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Is this the place?
Oh \96\96 Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Well, sure I do.
Today, over at the house.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Daddy!
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
What's that?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Well then, how do you know?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
How's that?
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
Got a match?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
George, can I see you for a second?
Violet Bick!
Some other time, George.
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
When?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in \96\96 providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about all your other friends?
Well, hello.
I'm not very good at this.
Do I look as funny as you do?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Uh-huh.
I'll take it. And then what?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
About what?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Have fun.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Is it snowing?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
You forgot something.
Great!  Find one for me.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Yeah, it's her job.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Where're we going?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
We're carrying weight.
Throw it.
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Positive I.D.?
I know just where to go.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Untie that rope.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Where to?
Because.
Pop....
Michael.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
What makes you think there might be?
Probably.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Listen -- what are you doing later?
Let's get the kid home.
Eat Cheerios.
Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
One what?  Ah-ha!
Oww!
Nothing.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
I know what you're going to say.
Because of today?  The beach?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Martin, it could be anything.
Martin, could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something?
Harbor Air, do you read?  Over?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
You're not going out right away, are you?
Mike!  Are you going out?
Did you ever see a dolphin?
Get a dance yet?
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
But first, a little juice....
Anything.  Anything.
How much longer?
What is it?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I don't care.
What about me?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
They're turning around.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Wave to my son.
Oh, my God....
It hasn't adjusted.
He's going with you, Doctor.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
It's Miller time!
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Thank you.
Till this opens, not our wedding.
Pre-opening jitters.
You called, Doctor?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
What do I do now?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Mmmm... you smell good.
They said you'd be here.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
So?
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Me.
You don't have to prove anything.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I will.
I want that shark alive.
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
When did this happen?
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
So, you just get here?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Take it up!
What're you doing later?
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
What kind of trouble?
Look great, don't I?
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How'd you do in school?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
She still talking to you?
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
Where are you going?
Make a list.
Turn it off....
Where have you been...?
You knew...?
Where's my mother?
All he did was kiss me....
Michael!  This thing working?
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
That hurt....
Yes!
No, no...It's too dangerous....
I almost forgot....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
Sit down, Ma....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Dad died from a heart attack....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
How are you doing?
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
It got him....
Can you just go off...?
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
It was no accident....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I don't know how....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
I have two right feet.
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I could take some time off....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
You sure you don't need glasses?
Want to go for a little ride?
You the architect?
Hurry!
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy....
Keep it steady....
Matt?
You tagging them...?
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Money is money....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
Where is everybody?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I invited you...
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them.  You hearing anything?
Shove it....
All the time....
Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
It's my fault...I have to....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
She's in management....
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
How's the new residence?
There's nothing in the files?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
What do you want it for?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
That isn't what you said before.
You believe me, don't you?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Stop it.
She wasn't lying about the van.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
What exactly you doing, John?
What if we need a back up?
How do you know her hair's black?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
Have you got a print from the hand?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Is this normal?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
I know what a "witness" is.
Yes, Sir.
You must have some idea about him.
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
What color was it?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Oh.
Are you married?
Sorry?
I know what you're like ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Interview over, Blattis ...
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
He's happy, darlin ..
You want something, darling?
Now.
I just heard.
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
No one has ever dumped me.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
No no...
Can I help?
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Now what did you lose?
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Wonder what he said.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Oh God.
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
Wait. Where is he?
I heard.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
What happened to Denver?
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
You never had The Talk, did you?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
I'm sorry I asked.
Jerry!  You made it --
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
I'll go back to them.
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
I don't see any.
What's going on, Jerry?
Show me the animal, Jerry!
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Her new boyfriend.
Sorry.
What did you say!
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Where's Dad?
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
They couldn\92t climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
You rented an automated litter box.
Absolutely not.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
I CAN GET HIM!
You remember the sounds they made?
Good luck with the fund raising.
What did you think?
We need to head for the coast.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Bonitas.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Hmmm.
Billy!
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
It matches the pictures.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I don't believe you.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Hi, Dad.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What?
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
We took to the rock.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
You version of it.
Their what?
Then this is our chance.
There' no reason for name calling.
?!
What do they want?!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
So what's your story, Nick?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
-- way we could safely --
WHAT ARE YOU-
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Phones are out too.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
How many lines of code are there?
You shouldn't use my name.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
Carousel.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Why would they care what we think?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Ellie, com one!!
Do you see anything?
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No. We can't.
And scary.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
I don't believe it.  I expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
I read your book.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
So am I going to help you with your foot?
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You know what this is?  It's a dinosaur egg.  The dinosaurs are breeding.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What's to be scared about?  It's just a little hiccup in the power.
Oh my God!
What?  What can we do?
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Can't you stop these things?!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I hate trees!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
That's not true...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
What's going on?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Sorry.
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
You watch this garbage?
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
Oh?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
See this?
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Where's he going?
You know how to use one of those?
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
Yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
The Castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it's an escape route.  Don't get stuck.
-- You appreciate my writing.
The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, sir.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
When I have no reason to doubt.
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Probably not.
I'll bear that in mind.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
What's the matter?
It's gone out so quickly?
All these in the last year?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
I could always apply there.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
Then that's the place for us!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Get the hell out of here.''!
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Give it back!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
What was it, Jack?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Are you nervous Jack?
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Why?
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Why? She's a junkie.
Yes?
Do you always have to repeat?
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
Oh no.
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
Why?
Honest?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
It's kind of late.
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
What's the matter?
The same as Jane McKenna.
Please.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
You and I -- a relationship.
Oh look what he did in them.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
I called Trina.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
You wanted to, or you are?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Have you discussed this with them?
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Not unusual.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
What about my orange juice?
You're late.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want a pizza.
I think I'm going to throw up.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Is mom ever coming back?
Sleep tight.
See you in the morning light.
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Wow!
Are you going to get remarried?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
And what is your present salary?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection.
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
So do I.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
Where are you going?
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Only can I still see him?
Wow!
Listen, don't let it get you down.  You're going to be fine.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
How should I know?
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
John?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
You're on your own, understand?
You're sure?
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
Thel, listen to me.  If, on the million to one shot that I should--  That anything should happen to me.  Would you take care of Billy?
We must go, Holiness.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
I need to squeeze this brain.
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
How big is Tibet's army?
What can I do? I am only a boy.
What is the size of our army, now?
Did you ever doubt it?
Me?
Things change, Kundun.
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
This is Britain.
This is Tibet. And this is China.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Tell me.
You, kill me?
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
You are in great danger. The Dalai Lama cannot fall into Chinese hands. You must flee.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Like my mother.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
I'll sue you.
It seems like we're getting lower.
Go!!!
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Was he a good man?
This is a setback.
Asia?  How... how could he get here?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Excuse me?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
In Maine?
Same thing from Fish And Game.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
I'm not mushing it.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Are we crazy?
Get him onto shore.
You sure?  I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
We set?
You said nobody came in here!
He's done.  He's dying.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Hey!!
With what?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Well Hector's a giant cracker.
What is she doing <u>now</u>?  <u>Mother</u> <u>of</u> <u>God</u>.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Did you get him?
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, <u>you</u>... you're y'know...
Hey.
Sorry?
Are you on drugs?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
"- every day."
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Why?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
I am, yes.
That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
They all were.
Go, Doctor.
On what basis would they reject him?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
Where were you going?
Starling.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
My God, you've grown up.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Much further?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Some say that's the way of it.
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Fort Edward, then?
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
How long?
Where do we go from here?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
Got a reason to stay.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese...
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Such as...?
And?
Why Sixpack?
DeJesus!  A readout!
Doc eat already?
It's got Hazy!
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
The internal monitors read normal.
Oh, God, she's out there...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Okay, number 23's full.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
If he had his blinkers on--
So that's all you do?...
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Getting some food.
I'm going to try to remove it.
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Who were you talking to?
It needs blood?
The shack...
It saw us!
Bitch!  Look what you did!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
A what?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
Yes?
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
Have you counted the money?
They were going to pay, then?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Son?
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
Dog, I have found the cash!
It must be this one.
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
What do you mean?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
Tom?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I'll see ya.
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
Hello, can I help you?
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
My van is half full.
What have you come as?
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
The money, the gear!
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
That isn't true.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Do whatever they tell you--
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Because it's a job?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Private Johnson!
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
A .45--
Just wondering.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
I'm not picking it up.
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You look good--
Suppose not.
You've been in this house for a while?
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
So how come you got into all this?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Are we going to ever see your father?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
What?
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
Hey, Mikey--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Treasure hunter?
Black Seminoles?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Eladio Cruz.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
This girl has a child?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
When we backed you--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
And Buddy was one of them.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
Morning, Hollis.
Charley Wade.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There was a mandate in the last election--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Right. When he was killed.
Nobody's too busy.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
People didn't complain?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Mom?
She finally got in--
You got in late last night.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
So what are we gonna do about this?
You're out early.
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
They got telephones.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
How come you don't took familiar?
Nix.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
You did.  Didn't you?
Please.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
He's with us...
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
And are you afraid?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
Sorry.  You asked.
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Are they treating you okay?
They were jealous of him.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Yes.
Are you all right?
... oh... God...
Is it finished?
Valentin?
Bad show last night?
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
And this Butterfield guy--
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
They weren't worth a damn.
What are you, my mother?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Was that Swann's idea?
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Was he taking a lot of risks?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Or murdered, like Nix.
So Nix won't come looking for her?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
That's where we're all going.
This is where we killed him.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Maybe... I... don't...
Why's that?
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Try twenty-five.
Hi again, how's it going?
Not really. How long are you here for?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I don't want to go home.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
Did I scowl at you?
I don't remember.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
But, I'm mean.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Oh.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
You think so?
What do you want to drink?
I'm going to miss you.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Hi, Lydia.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Ok.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Hospital?
Hello? Yes?
Evelyn Waugh?
I don't know what to do.
Hair stuff?
Do you think it's done?
John! What are you doing here?
Uh..thanks.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
I found them in your file box.
I can take care of myself.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Is he going to be okay?
You'll do it?
What is it?
He spoke to you?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
You killed my parents.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
So...we won?
Well I know he's come here before.
Oh my God!
Yes... and you are?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I'll bet.
So what'd I miss?
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
What?!?!
Yes, I know.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Get up!!
You okay?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
What do you mean?
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
No oxygen to the brain.
What can I do?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
Good seeing you again.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Thanks again for everything.
Parents died?
What?
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
What?
No, I mean I can check it for you.
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
You might be the only one with a job.
A horse?
I found you someone.
You do.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
Thanks, Sidra.
What's that?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
One, up.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
You do act different.
What do I have to do?
I don't like flowers.
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
Didn't know you cared so much.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See you made it.
You don't look half-bad.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Early night for you, isn't it?
Mulholland Drive.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Why?
Four.
What?
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Hey.
Who was that?
You want to go talk?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Least you got your priorities straight.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You don't think so?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
What are the doctors saying?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
You visiting?
It just isn't.
You're serious.
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Cause I don't get it.
From basketball.
I'll play you.
And what happens when you lose?
With who?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You scared me.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
You work too hard, Pop.
What people?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Sorry.
What's Mom think?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
From your mouth.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Your mother wants to hear from you --
What?
Yeah, but I don't know --
No.
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
No.
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
So you've done it --
Yeah.
It's ok.
C'mon guys, settle down --
What?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
....do you know who I am?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I'm sick.
This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
Braces?
I've been a good worker --
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
I need to sit down.
How's today then?
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
...ah...
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Jack.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
Hello?
I think you have the wrong number.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
-- just to clarify --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
And what did your parents do?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And your father?
I'm sorry.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
It's not your given name, right?
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
Marcie.
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Been drinkin' today?
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
What the hell is this Marcie?
...you know...
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What happend to you?
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
Slowly or quickly?
-- did she talk to you?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
hey.
That's it.
No.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I'm sorry.
Do you still have to do homework?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
You don't want any water?
Are you on drugs right now?
Let me call you a car, Linda.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
No, Linda, you don't understan --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Partridge?
mmm.hmm.
Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
C'mon, man.
You coulda been in front --
Go to it, handsome.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Who is he, Aramis?
And people close to him, who --
You can do it.
We must stop him!
Poor Phillippe!
Where are you going?!
What you're asking is impossible!
Then to the Bastille.
No!  Stop --
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
But why?
We go someplace dangerous.
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
D'Artagnan!
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
A personal nature?
Betrothed?  I think not.
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Silence!  I order you!
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
I was told this impostor was dead!
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Continue.
You dead yet?
You've... memorized...?
Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Exactly why it should be given away.
Did you know... about Raoul?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
What do you think?
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
Let's roll -
What's this?
What?
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Zydowski.  It's about time.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Captain?
Where up north?
No...
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
What?
No...I'm in some trouble...
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Oh man...what happened?
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
Donut?
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
What?
It was you who did the asking.
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.
How much do you know?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
Why not?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
For Christ's sake, why?
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Run it.
Get me a plane!
When are you coming back?
Will?
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It's the guard in the storeroom.
...twenty-eight minutes.  Cryptography at Langley?
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
What's being photographed?
When do you need it?
I'll see you later. All right?
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you see?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Come in.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Linda doesn't come in nights.
Okay.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's misunderstood.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Blue is cold.
...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
Do you remember what you said?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
And... where are things?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
That's right.
Lt. Fisk said...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
I figured I'd ask you...
How?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Andy!
Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like --
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Do you wanna tour the clubs?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Right...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Go away.
How can you be so casual??!
So?  What do they know?
It's so dirty.
I was very original!
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Positive.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
"Burlesque"?
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Why...?  Andy, why...?
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
What?!
Do you?
You don't, do you?
Are you sure this line is clean?
There's something about him, isn't there?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Do you always look at it encoded?
Dead.  All dead.
Just get me outta here.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Holy fucking shit!
What the fuck do they want with me?!
How?!
The cubicle across from you is empty.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
... am I dead?
Why do my eyes hurt?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
This is incredible.  I know kung fu.
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Do you understand, Neo?
And she's never wrong.
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Did you believe in them too?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
And I know that's not where you want to be.
God...
What is it?
Is Morpheus alive?
What happened?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, you're not.
Neo, how did you do that?
Morning.  Did you sleep?
It's a city?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Which way?  Which way?
It's locked.
What just happened?
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Well, we want good stuff.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
I gotta get the stuff.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
Get out of here before this really goes up.
Where to?
Waddaya think?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
What do you mean?
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
Hello, Michael.  I've got something for you...not much...but...
What are you going to do?  Hide me?
Nope...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Hey, where you been?
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
"Francis Macomber."
Maybe, who knows.
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Come on.
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Yeah.
Look who's talking.
Dinner?  Again?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
I hate parties --
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
-- Black.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I wasn't going to say --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, but --
And that?
What do you do that for?
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Hot or cold.
Who are we talking about?
No, I don't --
I'm not stepping anywhere --
It's going to be great --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Mind if I throw up?
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
He was interested.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
But I didn't mean to do it!
He said that?
Don' be facety, woman.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
Black.
Thanks.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
What are you doing here?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Joe --
I came to see you.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
You first.
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Susan --
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
How long have I got?
When you go, I go.
How are you?  How're you feeling?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Uh-huh.
And more.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
You were just curious?
About Susan?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
'Spooning'?
You're what?
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Which is what?
So that's what love is?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I don't like what you're saying.
I told you to shut up.
Yes.
That's me.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'Yes' what?
I didn't ask any question.
Where are you?  Are you there?
Where are you?
'Take me'...?  Where?
I'm sorry --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
...There's a start for a meeting.
Do you love Drew?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Don't get carried away.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Aw, you're tough.
You're terrible.
Thank God.
What is it, Daddy --?
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
I love you, Daddy --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I've got patients coming in --
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Why?
You said you liked me.
38.
Well, what then?
Slam it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Condition?
So you're holding my calls?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
What?
Yeah.
It's isolated.
Sleep okay?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
Such as?
It's not easy to be calm when -
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
What are you gonna do?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What does he want?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
How?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
My wife.
A BEER, please.
My name's Leonard.							 *
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Shut your mouth!
Why?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Prove it.
Unfinished business.
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
She has no idea who I am.
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
What cop?
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Oh, yeah...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
You need to consider a few issues.
I got to talk to my ADO...
So...?
How many?
My end?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
We want it back.
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Where's that?
Your father?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Hola, chica.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Would you find me...?
Is this the protective male talk?
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
No part of it wasn't real.
Packaging?
You got something to say, Jos\E9, let's hear it.
What is it?
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
What do we got?
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Where'd you go?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
What is going on...?!
I am asking.  You to me.
What's your take?
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Never heard of him.
They had me from the gate.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
You sure?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos\E9 knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Equipment?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
What the hell did you do?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
You sure you heard what I said?
You ain't coming to work?
Yeah?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You got a comb?
I'm scared.
These guys're good drivers.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I'm going to Florida.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Ready for hard work, son?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Get lost.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Getchmis olsun
Twenty months?
Years?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
Who?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Those mountains? are they?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
Yes...?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Just what?
How much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
Feeling all right?
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
You got your stuff?
Okay?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
What?
Whose?
Just got some news on Bell.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
You're ayip!
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
There's some weird shit here.
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
Show that to the station manager.  Tell him Leonard's gonna have his bubble-butt he don't have someone down here in ten.
Look, I showed you my badge...
The Department of Public Health...
Its muscles are locked.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
He's special.
My God, what the hell are you...?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Just inner chambers...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
Honey, just leave it.
Great crowd.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Talk to me.
No...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
My God.
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
I'm not much of a critic.
You want to read it?
I can take it, go ahead.
I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page 75.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
See, isn't this nice?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
It'll only take a second.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Well, it certainly says you.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Hey, Pete.
Marcia, please.
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
Your room.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
See anything you like?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
What are you talking about?
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
Not exactly.  Wallis?
It is, Billy.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
We're due to take off.
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
Do you know me?
- right..where is it?
- this is very disconerting..
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
So where did I got right?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
There's nearly 2 million in London.
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
-- his left jacket pocket.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
No.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
'Terrorists?'
And then what?
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
It's the transponder.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Roger that.
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Now how to get in there.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
That's S.O.P..
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
What kind of show.
Maybe we don\EDt have to know what he looks like.  If he\EDs got that list, he\EDs going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
I didn't say that.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Kittridge...
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
You\EDre in Prague?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Yes.  I see your point.
What?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
What makes you trust me?
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
Very good.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Higher.  Higher.
I thought I was going to see Max.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I thought I'd take some now.
I\EDve got a shadow.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize it\EDs over, you\EDre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you\EDve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, we\EDll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
The Shawfish?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I won't pay for nothing.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I have my eyes open.
Where's Ma?
You look tired.
Here.
You're married.
Oh, Cosmo!
You haven't once said you like my dress.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Yeah, this is Ronny.
I have no life.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
When you get engaged?
Why?
I don't know.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
I've got you.
What about Johnny?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Why not?
What?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
No thanks.
I'm really afraid.
Let me go home.
Ronny!
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I like this ring.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
No.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
And we'll sell the house.
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What! How do you know?
What the hell happened to you?
He's with his dying mother!
WHAT!! She was dying!
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Hi, Loretta.
Alright.
He should pay.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
That's it! That's the reason!
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
May I presume to ask you a question?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Yes.
Then why are you eating alone?
Go ahead.
Nerves.
You knew that man?
I guess you can't invite me in?
People home.
Yes.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
What?  Ridden on a horse?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
The same!
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Hello.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
They're nervous, sire.
We shall attack at once.
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Behind the rabbit?
Oh, shut up.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
That's easy!
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
I can't.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Did you kill all those guards?
They cost fifty pounds each!
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Rather what?
But, Father.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Well, she's got a point.
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
Hurry!
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
I done it again.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
Not bad, not bad.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
And she sent no word down?
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
What's this?
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I wish to see my mother.
What did you say?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
You'll be sent a message.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
What brings you here?
Dare say you can be taught.
You sent for me.
Surely --
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Too busy looking after themselves.
And the pony?
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
What are those?
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
Erysipelas.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Why not?
Where is my son?
What do you mean?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
So where is he?
No, in person.  Now.
No, wait.  Just listen.  I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name.  As soon as I turned it on, Nick.  It said my name.  How could it know?  And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here".
Something's happened to them.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
That's what I thought.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
Jesus Christ!
What are you looking for?
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
What is it?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
I'm thinking!
So what do you think?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
But I'm not broke.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So, what did they say?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
It's unbelievable!
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Betty.
You're still here?
Yes?
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No.
No...I need to sleep.
What's wrong?
Okay... but just...just to see.
"So... surprise"...
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Don't stop!
Those men in front, in the car.
I don't think...
No, we don't.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
It's kind of embarrassing but,
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
Where are we ?
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
How long till the room fills ?
He hired you to build this place ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
And you believe that ?
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
You okay ?
I don't get it.
Do you know where you're going ?
Just stop it. End it here.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
Don't eat at the console.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Not down here. I'll start trusting you when I feel there the time is right. It's not personal, it's just survival.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
What's wrong ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Of course.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
One moment dear... 
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Bruce has just awaken.
Will he make it out ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Look ! Look !
That is repugnant. You have the habits of a goat.
Thank you very much.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
How's your foot ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
Umm, where do you want this?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I don't think you're very polite.
THANK YOU.
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
No nuns, got it.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
I will. How's Shelly?
What happened to Shelly?
We have a baby?
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I told you it was a long story.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
This is really very nice of you.
Vada?
Your mother?
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
Thanks
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
Getting off please.
Vada.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Get married?
Care for a smoke?
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Uh oh...
It's dangerous!!
It's not his fault!
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
No problem.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
But...are you engaged or something?
Committed?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
I should do this myself.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Bye Aunt Rose.
So what's wrong?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
It would be fantastic.
Really?
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.
Of what??
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I had a good time tonight.
I haven't danced in.....
Kiss me.
I ahh, better go.
Goodnight Shelly.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
VADA!
Of course not.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad??
Goodnight Vada.
When??
Yes..
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
Hi Vada.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
Did I kill my mother?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Why?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
No, no no....
This is one big house for one single person.
What do you get for that?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Please.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Does he love her?
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
Shut your big fat mouth!
Big Ringo fan.
Are you married?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Goodnight.
Thomas J?
I knew he wouldn't come.
No, I'm going home.
Hurry!
Naah, I don't wanna.
Your lip bleeding?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Who's that with your Dad?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Bed wetter!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I do, she's real funny.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
You better not either.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  Which means safe, something I'd wear.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
You don't miss much.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Zit cream?
I give.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
I did what I came to do.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
And the answer was so simple.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
I never want to go through this again.
Ex-cuse me?
I think he's been fired.
And she's all wrong for me!
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You never eat when you're despondent.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Jules, what's wrong...
Uh.  I saw that moving...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
No.
Barnett, please -
You have to what?
Barnett?
Am I disturbing you?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
You want anything?  A drink?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Where are you going?
Sorry to bother you, Bud.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Well, Mr. Green.
When you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at Bishop's Pub. They let you pass the hat. All these kids do that. Most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Did you see who that was?
Uh huh.
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
You got a place to stay?
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
How long have you been with them?
Do you ever do any writing?
I'm not sure. Where?
Hello.
Hello.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
When did you think it would happen?
I knew when I first met you.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Where are you going?
We just got a gold record.
Why?
What do you think of him?
Spent time in Arizona. Why?
I know a couple.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
You think it will?
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
What kind of pies do you have?
What did you think then?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
By all means, knock yourself out.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
You guys stay on your bellies.
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Yes.
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
What I'd like to do---
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Yeah baby.
Yes.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Are you all set?
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Rollin'...and speed!
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Fill her up?
Boy - you hear me?!
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
Want to talk to you.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Want to keep your job, boy?
What d'you want?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
I don't know. He's your boy.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's two bucks, Joe.
That's right.
How about another beer?
Hell!
How d'you mean?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Get out of here!
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Hi.
What d'you mean?
Thank you.
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Hi.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Don't do that!
I don't think that'll happen.
Like a home, for one thing.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Wouldn't have known you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
How about a drink?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Couldn't get the words out before.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Let's stay here, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Got a thick feelin' here.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
What are you doing in here?
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
I saw your girl yesterday.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Ready?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
What about the route to the core?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Want to fucking answer them?
I know who you are.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
What about before that?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
It sounds like you.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Get up.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
What?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
YOU DID.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Who told!
You don't think I can do it.
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Okay. That's bad.
Now this is cute.
Hi!
Wow. It's packed.
George! What are you doing here?
What is this?
You guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
How many times have I fired her?
A--flack jacket.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh my god.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Better person than I.
It's just for a couple of months.
Josie Grossie.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
You ruined the whole thing!
Aloha! Welcome!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Shock.
He sure is big, Jack...
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Taste it.
Why not?
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
He needs professional help.  I think we should take him to a psychiatrist.
I'll kill you now.
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!
Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me to do?
Are you sure?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
It's gone now.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
What's so funny?
Jess?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Yor dad picking the music again?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
Jennifer --
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
That was different.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
It's over.  It's over.
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
Yes, tell us, Nancy.
This is nice.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
The truth.
What are we going to do?
You're not going in.  That's exactly what he wants.  As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
My God.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Why is he after us?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  You'd be wasting your money.
Sorry about that...
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Busy tomorrow?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
So who left who?
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Cartwright.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
With a goat playing a violin.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
I don't know what happened.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
You disappeared.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Yup.
No.  Not true...
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Bella -- this is Anna.
Still loves you though.
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
That's nice.
What do you think?  Good move?
I'll see what I can do.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
I did.
Cappuccino as ordered.
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
Absolutely.  Never trust a vegetarian.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
No, sir.
No, sir.
Can I help you?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Which was?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Oh my God...  Hello.
Yes.
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Billy?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Yes, ma'am...
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it?  You must try to talk about it, Billy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
You men remain seated!
Yeah, ya should've come along with us, Miss Ratched, an' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two.
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Welcome back.
I hope everything is settled.
Good. Why don't you join us?
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Break it up, God dammit! Ain't I got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can't depend on nobody.
M-M-Mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
A bus?
What is it, kid?
H-h-how's it g-g-going, Mack?
In ya go...
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Sock it to 'em, kid!
What for?
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
It's the questions she asks.
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Twenty-five dollars.
Giving up?
So why are you talking to him?
What's your plan, Mack?
Bet a nickel!
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Hit me!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
I wanna go home!
Jesus God...
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
How are you feeling?
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
You look pretty healthy to me.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Ten bucks.
Somebody's coming!
Got a cigarette?
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Hey, how ya doin'?
What are they?
Please follow me.
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Hi.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Is everything all right?
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
He is your husband, no?
So, what's the story with your friend?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
No, really.  What's she doing?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
There is one other thing you should know about me.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Congratulations.
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
How could you do this to me?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Why are you asking me this?
So?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Why not?
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
You okay?
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Is something the matter?
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
What would you call it?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
So what do you think?
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
Is everything okay?
You don't have any idea?
It's a miracle.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
So?
A phone message.  Only--
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
He's heeeeeerrre...
Faith--
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Why?
Whatareyoudoing?!
And he is living proof.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
A porco?
How old are you?
Huh?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
And you didn't tell her?
I have to talk to her.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
Right now?
I'm gonna take her home first.
Well, where are they?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the\97 er\97 as you put it\97 main order of business?
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against\97 
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night\97 we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready\97 remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens\97 This bum Wilson he gets the title shot\97 outdoors in the ballpark! \96 and what do I get\97 a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too\97 don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Terry...?
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work\97 with all them muscles. 
You know how the Sisters are.
In braids? That's right.
I'd better go in.
The Golden Warriors.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
How do you like that one?
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
It's quite\97  \96nice.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
And when things get in your way\97 or people \97you just knock them aside\97 get rid of Them\97 is that your idea?
I\97 I'd like to, Edie, but\97  \97there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says\97
You're not sore at me?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
What are you going to do?
Edie!
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me\97 he says it's up to me.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I know what you want me to do!
Terry, no, no... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Edie.
Thanks just the same.
My pigeons... .
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
About Edie?
Your gun.
What do you think?
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
Waterfront\97 Crime\97 Commission\97 ?  What's that?
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I think you could have.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
What's the matter wit' you, success gone to ya head?
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
Give me a double.
No advice. Just whiskey.
You ought to go home and take care of that\97
Terry?  What do you want?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
My favorite little cousin.
I\97 I was just on my way up, Johnny.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'\97 take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros\97  \97away and you're a great big hunk of nothing\97  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
You think one bottle's enough for all them toasts?
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
I am--It's our only chance.
You do?
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
What kind of symbol?
She was?
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
Well?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
They are live ones?
We don't know of anything, Master...
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
No. No! No!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
What do you suppose for?
What're you talking about?
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Ask him his name.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
They look like plain old rocks.
You talked to him?
I have to qualify, is that it?
Daniel.  Listen --
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
That's all I wanted to know.
You get the key?
Leave it where it is.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
The fuck you talking about?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
We still talk, though.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
You know who this is?
Think I could have them back?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
A girl.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Well, does it make sense to you?
You getting serious on me now?
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You think he's lying?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Take your sunglasses off.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The flight?
You busted out?
There were others.
She did, huh.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
And is Foley a part of this?
Why's that?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
Hi, Ray.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He doesn't even look like that.
Was it Foley?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
Land of the free...
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Nah, you go on.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
Get me into a plane!
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
It's not getting any longer.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
So beautiful!
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Don't get smart with me, son.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
How'd you get this?
How often you fight like this?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
What else can we do?
What?...
It must of been a convincing letter.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots, we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
The only one?
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Charlie, how are you?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Come back to me.
I thought you were...for a while.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon?
Terry! Slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
It was Beth's idea.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Coffee and a donut.
This is great reefer.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Young lady, you're drunk!
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Damn that Charlie I
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
All right. But this better be good.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
For me?
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light\97headed.
I'm excused.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Sort of.
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Where have you been?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
And the butter.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life\97styles.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
What will they be made of?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I was building a doggy door.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Who was that?
Just out.
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
Why not?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
How long have you been here?
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
Jesus.
What in God's name... ?
Do you really think so, Andy?
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Why are you getting dressed?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
We're not skipping this treatment.
Fuck you.
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
I'm not ready to die.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Client of yours?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
Nine.
My lover and I.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Thanks for your time.
Who'd you get?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
There is no relevant precedent.
PARRTYY!
I'm a law suit.
What?
Opera?
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Excellent work, Joe. I thank you.
Thanks for coming by.
Do you need a break?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
In some situations.
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
No. I can't really see it.
Hello?
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
Where's Dad?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
Objection!
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
A homosexual encounter.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Let's put it this way, Andy: your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure.
How many gays do you know?
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
Let's continue.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
You came for us....
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
What about her?
Back to the ship, huh?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we'll need more cells.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
How much you weigh, Johns?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Fry?
One is all?
Hasan?
What're you doin'?
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
So much for your nightfall.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Dr. Zaius --
Seal the cave?
Where does the river lead?
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
'I am not a missing link.'
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
How did it go?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
Landon! Send a last signal.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Can we take a dip?
No cigar.
We got off at the wrong stop.
What is that?
One is in a museum!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
What about me?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Tell him to pull back!
Sure.	In a cage.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
What is this?
You! ... You knew about this?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Bunker...
Elias - you take your squad and I'll take Tex and Francis from your squad.  We move out in two-zero mikes. 
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Sarge?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
You lame Taylor?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Rhah! What's going on. Rodriguez's hole just got...
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
First time?
Feel good?
...But what'd she do?
Dawn! That was it!
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
What you got there - beers?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
What we got here a crusader?
Excuses are like assholes, Taylor - everybody got one.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Vancouver, B.C.
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
I think you're drunk.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Good evening, Miss.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Your liquor laws..
You're drinking it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Then he's got to be a detective.
Us?
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Well?
Cold?
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
In a way.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
And without much discrimination.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Who told you my name?
What's this in favor of?
It was lying where on the balcony?
How about a cup of coffee?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
Information.
It could have been an accident.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
You asked me where it all came from.
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
I wouldn't know. Just do it somewhere else. There is such a thing as good manners.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
It does.  May I go now? 
He checks too.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
But you still think she's innocent.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
What'll we do about it, Margo?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Be nasty.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Thank you.
Shall we go?
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
How's Mary?
Attributed?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Congratulations.  Who with?
I'll have some of that.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
In radio we're different.
Bastard.
You approve!
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Thanks.
Oh, I see.
I'm terribly sorry.  He doesn't seem to be here ... No ... Yes, if I see him, I will. .. Goodbye. She's going to phone back.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
Friends of yours, huh?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
Thanks for stepping in.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Three seconds... two... one...
You never were...
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Nothing?
I know where they're going.
Meaning you were expendable.
What's goin' on?
I... I gotta go.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I'll see you there.
Thanks.
Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him...
You saw what?
How could anyone get through this, carry Blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
Georgia.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
It's... it's not like that.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
No, you look like a hooker.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
What's your name, lover.
Get in.  This side.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Where'd you go?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
I'm not just talking about sex.
This isn't a date.
You're upset, huh?
Why not?
Okay.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
What if I lose it?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I know.  I'm glad.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
I didn't think so.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
I want to.
What time's diner tonight?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Why do you want to know?
Did I wake you?
I don't think there's any sense in --
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
What!?
You broke my nose.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Looks slow tonight.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Kit...
You sure you won't come with me?
Couple a hours.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
You bullshittin' me?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
May I help you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yes?
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
What?
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I killed him myself.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Why should that make such a difference?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Have you any money?
You've been mostly dead all day.
-hold it, hold it-
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
Yellin.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
A technicality that will shortly be remedied. But first things first. To the death.
Now?
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
No --
-- anything you want --
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
How old were you?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Making sure nobody's following us.
Go in, get after her!
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
You guessed wrong.
Guess what.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Good, what is it?
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Yes, what?
What do you mean?
What scheme?
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
What are you doing?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
To failure!
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Not.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do you need us?
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
We make love?
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Finder's keepers.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
I solemnly swear...
By the sacred memory...
Okay.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
No. I told you, she's confined...
Let's all talk about Mary.
What's your interest?
Casharoonie!
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
Call her sister! If no one's answering at the house....
She stole some money.
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I was getting to that!
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
I ought to call the police right now!
She haven't even called you?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Let's go see Al Chambers.
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
What is it?
It's regular. Okay?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
For what?
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
You're very... kind.
I imagine so.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Thank you, Norman.
Phoenix?
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Frankly, yes.
Is there?
Norman took a wife?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
Yes.
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
He's inherited a fortune.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Thousands?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
I don't have any affairs. What do you mean?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Why didn't you eat last night?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
But I think these things are beautiful.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Let me go! Let me go!
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
That's the one.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
He might get some publicity out of it.
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
What is it? What happened?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Fire insurance!
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What are you laughing at?
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Could we go somewhere?
Could be.
Yes?
They're filthy, Mother.
In what sense were they bad?
Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels?
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll?
Yeah.
Are they polar bears, too?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It's funny you would mention Rose, I was thinking about her all the way up in the car.  Or maybe it isn't so funny.
The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.
Please do.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Well, she's back.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Boys? You say to me boys?
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Honey!
Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie,
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, what are you doing up?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Strange voices, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Rose... I hate to be mean, but...  Oh, nevermind, forget it.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Well, no, I didn't actually.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was going to tell him.
Indivisible and inseparable.
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Who cares?
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Kittle...
How's your precious little school-marm today?
You shouldn't litter.
I can work this.
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
What's the plan?
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
What's mine say?
That's him alright.
I can't believe we're stealing.
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I'm gonna get beside him.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
What... ?  Not you too?
Any preferences?
Been waiting long?
How'd we do?
What the hell's his problem?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You suck at lying, Archie.
You always did have style.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Your eyesight will return in time.
As you wish.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
Are you all right?
Someone who loves you.
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. This isn't gonna be easy.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
All wings report in.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Yes. It's you Leia.
Come with me.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yes or no will do.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
You promise you won't tell?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
What was that bang?
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
Oh....Say something.
Well I want to leave.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Oh Brad.
Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
Hello.
What a guy
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...T-thank you.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Don't you open them anymore?
...And he called the reporters --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
...Can't do it.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
No... I can't!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
He won't last one round.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
He got lucky.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Did ya get the license number?
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Few minutes?
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
A hundred an' thirty.
What about for food an' stuff?
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
How'd you know?
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Excuse me.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
What?
Make your teeth yella --
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
More like thirty.
The legs must be goin'.
...Who'd ya fight?
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Did ya get the message, kid?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Whatta' those?
...What?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How I look out there, Mick?
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
...What kinda dog is this again?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Hey --
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
...Maybe I better forget it.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
Ya really like her?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Are you gonna call him, Eddie?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Well, why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Does it hurt?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
You shot Roger.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Angelo?  He's a pal, a chum...
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
No better?
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Is the day so young?
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Good marrow, father!
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Where is my Lady's lord?
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
Juliet!
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
So thrive my soul--
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Meaning, to court'sy.
A most courteous exposition.
A Plague o' both your houses.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Of course.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Lose them!
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
How so?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
Then I guess we're set.
And you respect him.
American.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
Created?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
All in the stomach, though.  Your man might live.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
I didn't know that you spoke French.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
It was at that.
You're with Interpol -- you're a cop.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Clearly.
You sure your friend got the right place?
I never made that claim.
How could you have done that?
Give me a cigarette.
Do we need anything else?
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
That's a good question.
You have to stop doing that!
Let's get him out of here...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
What happened to it?
Gaelic.
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
Can you get it?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Sort of!
Don't spend it all in one place.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I don't know...
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
He would have done it to us, right?
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
He's going to be trouble.
Well what are we supposed to do?
Not bad enough to kill him.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
I'm all ears.
Ok...I'll wait.  For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Hi.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
You're worth every last penny.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
So do I.
A satellite dish?
What?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Don't you have to be here?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
A lot of men come in here?
Just goes to show you.
Why?
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
Whatever...
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
Dwayne please calm down!
We're out of here.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Wait.
Look, I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
How'd you know?
What?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What's wrong?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
I have plenty of dates.
Not Yu.  You!
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Follow the Rich White Man?
How do you know he's our man?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I don't understand?
Wait!  There's people down there!
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
She saved our lives.
I'm not used to having a partner.
Well we're not friends.
See you in the next world.
What's a Chinese heaven?
How was the sex?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Steamed dumplings?
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
Let's go.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
No you didn't!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
That your gate down there?
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
A little Mu-shu.
I could use a little vacation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Put your arms around me.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
He was the best I ever trained, you know.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Feds asked for me?
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
You have one of these?
You speak English!
It's the same thing!
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Where were we?
Shortcut?
You make the plate?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Are you OK?
Which one?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, please, I don't --
I'm sorry, Lee.
What a surprise!
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Jesus...what do you want?
You OK?
What kind of assignment is that?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You sonuvabitch.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
You don't understand this guy.
Right.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Really?
Got any last minute advice?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Lawyers.  I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you.
In vino veritas.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Thanks.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done.  Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
It's nice that they're still friends.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
How romantic.
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Too much.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Where did you disappear to?
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I'm listening.
Ya think?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
But I'm weird.
Lighten up, wahine.
What happened at the luau?
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
It's delicious, trust me.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
About forever.
Walter.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
Oh!
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Yes.
What?
It's a sign --
This is a photo of hair.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
What are your plans in New York?
I love the symphony.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Please --
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
It's you.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
Why not?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Jed's got cables.
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
Great.
What are you doing up?
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
God, she's beautiful.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
When I found you?
I can't believe you flew first class.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Yes?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
It's a little derivative.
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
Oh.
He's ten.
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
You haven't tried locking them up!
Got any more ideas?
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Mama, can I put the candles ...
Why are they singing, Mama?
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Not just Juanito. You'll have it good too, Esperanza. We're going to win this strike.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Go on. Spill it.
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
Are you Australian?
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Oh God.
How?
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
I need my paycheck.
What's wrong, Danny?
Colette, go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
How you holding up?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
Finland is a country.
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
What?
But...I've seen you.
You don't trust me?
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
I welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
Come on, guys ...
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
Cool it. We got business.
What?
I was trying to score some dope.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
You've got no choice.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Excuse me?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Really?
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
She's 57 and she's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Casualties?
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Good luck, John.
Yep.
Last I knew.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
What do you think?
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Not yet.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
Glad of it.
I've been humming it.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
Over three-hundred.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
I wonder where they're going.
Captain, what about our deal?
You get a translator, Captain?
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Oh, yeah?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
I don't think so, Captain.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Jesus Christ, he's a natural!
Huh?
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Yes, sir.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
What's the profile?
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'll be in my office.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
Look at those eyes.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Yes.
Did you sleep with her?
So, what's your point?
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd is doomed.
Wait a minute.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
I can put that together.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
What are you doing?
What?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Do you love him?
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Honey!
Honey, about what?
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Hello.
You will?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Well...
So it's an honor?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
I think you should wear that.
After work?
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Yes.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Why didn't you tell me?
You shared it with a dick.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
How's it going?
It's your castle, man.
The truck?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Seriously, Lloyd.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My car.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
Certainly.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
Give me my firebird keys!
Later for you, Luke.
Now you're back.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Should I stay?
All right, okay, let's talk.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
You took my workers.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Where are the guards?
You asked for shoe polish.
God bless you, sir.
Like this?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
That'd be fine.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
I got to go, I'll see you.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I'll talk to him.
We need to talk.
They arrived.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
Shit.
I heard a noise.
Cotton.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I did that.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
It helped me realize one thing.
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Fair enough.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
Where is Sidney's father?
And are the police sure about that?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
What are you going to do?
I think he's doing Dolly.
How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
This is exactly what I don't want.
Where's Sid?
You\92re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It\92s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Yeah?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
This is all too familiar.
Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything?
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
What do you want?
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
What?
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
I got a surprise for you.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Oh, Sid, you\92re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
..it's really about family and tradition...
Hello?
Do you want to die?
I hate scary movies.
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
Jesus.  Hello?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
What do you mean?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
Alright Kincaid, no where to?
Who?
What do you know about trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
How is that good news?
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Why would the police come to you?
Off the record.
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Who's phone?
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Just because you knew her?
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
I think we should go inside. I have to have a talk with the cast. ALL OF YOU.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Hello.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Yeah?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Hello?
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Nope.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
You know that's not true.
No...
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Uh-huh.
Why did you kill my mother?
Hello?
Hello.
What?
Who is this?
Just some scary movie.
Why do you want to know my name?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
What kind of game?
I don't know...
But you're doing so well.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Evening, ma'am.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
So is Dewey your real name?
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
At the airport.
Any word on my Dad?
Have they found my father?
She's tough.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Jesus...
Where is she?
Where is she?
What? What?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'll look for it.
Please. You owe me.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Many times.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Besides --  "Takes a man to do something like that."
Jesus, this place is packed.
I thought everything was checked out.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
No way.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
How's that?
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
What the hell's going on?
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
You didn't know.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
You've made a good life for yourself...
Here he comes.
Somerset...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
Who said this was murder?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
This doesn't make any sense.
It's my wife.
How's that?
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
How do you know all about this?
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
Wait... just wait.
You stupid son of a...
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
You knew I'd say yes.
No.
What is it?
Slut.
Stay with him.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
How's California?
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Haven't seen you since the surrender.  Come to think of it, I didn't see you <U>at</U> the surrender.
What good does that do?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
What in...?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Well, the reward still stands...
Well, come on!
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
That don't make 'em kin...
No...She's not...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
But couldn't you...?
Why else?
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
Who's that?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Martin, what-
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
Frank Kosinski.  Here's the address.  Go see him.  Ask him.
Hello.  Can I help you?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Hammer?
Well, look here!
Ned\85I know\85I know
Oh
Wait!  Will you desist!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We will all be put in the clink.
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe, Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress; Aphrodite, who does it behind the Dog and
Most interesting.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
This time we take your boots off!
It is over.
Do you know it?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Where are you going?
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
Will! Have you finished?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
Kit
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
"Out."
God bless you!
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
As a nurse.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"\85All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Master Shakespeare
Like you, I found him not at home!
Who are you, master?
Better fortune, boy.
Oh my lady, my love!
And that was only my first try.
Moonlight!
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
"\85thou need'st not to be gone."
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?\85she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke\85Orsino.
But all ends well.
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
My lady Viola.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Good morning, my lord!
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Your aunt?
She sings too?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
"Poet?"
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
I won't be able to.
Finished.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
What's the problem?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
What? Yes, that's fine.
I want to secure it.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
No, can't think of anything else that matters.
Well, is it?
Parked outside?
Just one thing.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Cameron.
Who was it?
Hugo.
Don't.
I don't thinkI can.
I don't want to. It's different.
What's he doing here?
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
No.
Will you calm down.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
I don't see the point in that.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Later. But first -- him.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
We could put it somewhere.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
What?
Are you all right?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
So, uh...
It's OK. There's no problem.
It's about the burglary.
Of course.
No, I've never seen them.
Why do you want a room here?
Is this what they always look like?
I've never seen a dead body before.
That's what it cost, David.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
I thought you'd gone to work.
I'm sorry.
So let's go.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
But they sneer, don't they?
What do you do?
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
The human condition.
Both, sir.
Your watch.
Chicken salad.
I thought you were in a good mood.
What?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- is that right?
What're you looking for?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
What?
I'll be back in a while.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What're you doing later?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Comb my hair out later, honey.
That headboard.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Yeah...
No.
You are.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
And you need money?
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
You don't seem very sure.
Jill's coming with us.
... I don't get it done often.
No.
You know what I'm talking about.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Don't do it.
-- don't you want to --
-- gee...
You don't think so? I do.
-- sure.
So I'm saying it...
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What with?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Jackie Shawn.
-- yes, George.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Yeah.
George.
Great.
Egypt.
Television or movies?
Now, Jackie --
I don't want to fight, George.
Bullshit.
How come you took your own car?
Well that's something.
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, don't do this --
... well I'm glad you told me.
George...
What're you here for?
No.
But what?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
I know it, I know it.
Well anyway...
You live like a pig.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
I wanna hear about it, George.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Why, why do you think that is?
You really think so?
Awww --
You're home.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
I was too old.
Sid.
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Of course not.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
You and your touchy investors.
I'd like a drink.
They get hair all over the place.
Who are they?
Jackie Shawn.
Hi, Leonard.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
You're really a love -- you sure?
I thought you said things were great with George.
He does?
I would say so, yes.
What?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- uhh-huhh...
But why Egypt?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Johnny!
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
-- why?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- what's the problem, honey?
-- I'll get in the back --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
-- yes, Jill.
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Are you married?
No of course not.
Call me Les.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Dad?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Yeah.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
I won't make any noise.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Shall we go into the living room?
Please...
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Beg pardon?
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
Did you find anything?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
can of itself be a problem.
This is the staff wing of the hotel. None of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
Thanks.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I've been hearing noises in there.
It isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's got them to cancel the fair.
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
Yeah? Really?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Really.
I think I hear it!
He's... dreamy.  He's...
SING!
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What you do?
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
Oh, girls.
This prom is a real drag.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
Soprano or alto?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Van Cartier.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Come on, we're late.
A cigarette?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
We need experience.
Goddamn it!
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Sit down.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
No!  No!  I can't do this!
And the vow of chastity.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Sometimes it's not enough!
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
So I don't shop.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
No nothing.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
Like what?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I've got to go.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
What're you doing?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
It's done?
There she is!
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
She shouldn't have come back.  She knew she was in danger.
He's not like other guys.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Not a note.
But, Bishop...
If we could speak alone.
Certainly not.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
You must have missed your mark.
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
May we look at them now?
He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
What is that you wear?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Where are we going?
Out there.  What do you see?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
I hear nothing.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
All I saw was their lantern.
Did your father take a loan?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
Climb up!
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
You promised justice.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Blood.
What is so urgent?
Katrina...
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him?  The Redman?  I should tell you... he has been murdered.
Thank ye.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Can I help you?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
I ain't sure.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
You got that shit right.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
I want to be baptized.
Don't hit that boy no more.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
Why'd you live there?
Do you like to play football?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
How do you know?
Were they bad people?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I was goin' to the secret place. I borried one of your books to take down there. You ain't mad, are you?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Boy, folks sure had it rough back a long time ago, didn't they?
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
You all right, Mama?
Huh?
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
A blister shore can hurt.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Karl, you up?
Yeah.
I'll be.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Yes ma'am.
Thank ye.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
Do you have family here?
That boy wants me to.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Is he leaving right this minute?
What!
Like me, too.
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
What'll it be, Auggie?
Do me a favor, will you?
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Seven eighty-five out of twenty.  Take care of yourself now, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
They're all the same.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Did you ever go back to see her?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
No you're not.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
What's this?
And you're giving it to me?
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
A little. Not much.
No, it's five thousand dollars.
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Does it hurt?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Any time. And congratulations to you and your wife. Just remember, though, in the immortal words of Rudyard Kipling: "A woman is just a woman, but a cigar is a smoke.
I just want to know where he is.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
You going to sit here all day?
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
Thomas.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Yeah? Who is it?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
Mostly what.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Eight-thirty.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Appreciation for what?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, it might be.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Well?
Don't know how long it's take to get a charge...
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
I don't know.
Why?  If they could never take title.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
Robbed.  He was angry.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
That's when he fell.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
We don't let go, you s...
And what's that?
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Well...
Are you absol...
Wanna see my driver's license?
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
What happened?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
With me?
Nellie told us about it.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
You'd better go fix it.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
Good night, Daphne.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
And where's he going to be?
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you doing with my flowers?
That's some nerve!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Not that, you idiot.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
We'll take a rain check.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Anything wrong?
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
And your head is hot.
How's the bottle?
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I'm a what?
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
About that roadhouse -
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
What's the job?
We got it second-hand.
Yeah.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Happy days.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your view of what?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
Yeah.  Real hot.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Look at all that silverware.
Where's your shell collection?
Harmless - how?
What thing?
Have you tried?
Oh, it's not your fault.  It's just that every now and then Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.  Something goes wrong inside.
I don't want to bore you.
Would you do me a favor?
Well - ?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
That's funny - I never slept better.  And I had the most wonderful dream.  I was still on the yacht, and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and I was the crew - I kept a lookout for icebergs, and I sorted your shells, and mixed your cocktails, and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when I woke up, I felt like swimming right back to you.
Tomorrow night?
A little country club we run for retired bootleggers.  I'm gonna put your name up for membership.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
You know what I love about all this?
Perfect. All ginny.
Say something. Please.
What\92s going on with you two?
Who\92s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
You heading to the train station?
There\92s something about him that\92s just a bit odd.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Hey.
Ah, a philosopher.
Crikey.
Kat, wait. I don\92t want you hating me. We\92ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they\92re naked.
No, count it, anyway.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
There\92s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
Don\92t they have a limit at those machines?
I\92m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don\92t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It\92s your job. It\92s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
You\92re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
I should go.
You want me to let him in?
That\92s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
What do you say to that?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
That does it...
And you say all them people is dead now?
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Yes, sir...
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
You feel alright today, Daddy?
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Ready to go, Mama!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
What is it, David Lee?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's that you carryin'?
So when I left, she gave me these books.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
Whatcha got there?
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
You ready to eat?
But, Nathan--
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
What... are you?
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
To free Terrance and Phillip.
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
You're late, Cartman!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Mph rmph rm!!
Mph rm rmph!!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Oh yeah.
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
No... The General is right.
Who is it?
SHIT!
Oh my God...
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That was sweet!
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
What about air strikes?
And Bill?
You're all part of Satan's army now!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
Yeah!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Anna...
Excuse me?
So...
Were you going to give it to them?
So, are you on for the next one?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Is that clear?
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Really?
We don't.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
You're ready for the real thing?
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
Will you marry me?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Hello Mr. Kastle.  Junior, long time. I thought they locked you up and threw away the warden!
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
Theo.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Nice set-up.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Like this?
Get that outta your mouth!
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
Uh...over easy.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a boyfriend?
What's plan B?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
What are you going to do about your brother?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
How do you get this thing down?
Can I come with you?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
Fletcher, get away from there...
Get out of there!
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
Fifty yards and closing.
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
But you've tested it?
What was that?
Don't do it!
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Maybe older --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
What is it, Norman?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Harry's missing.
But sir --
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Wait a second --
Going active.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Yes, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
I did.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Some sort of lead or something.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed.
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
You're next, Norman.
400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth --
You fixed my suit?
But I don't know how --
What's the matter?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
P-a-r-a-s-o...
It's like a sleeping pill?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
You ever given an injection before.
I'm sorry.
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
You're lying --
You're insane.
Don't, Beth.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
What are you looking for?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
You're staring at me.
When did it come across?
C'mon.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
I don't follow you.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
No.  I didn't say that.
What is that?  That noise?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
... you there?  Norman?
What is it?
I can't reach her.
C'mon, Norman!
Gimme a second --
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Well, if it's a discharge --
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Beth and Harry?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
What report?
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
You want me to try?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Try this one.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Was it a military crash?
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
No, not anymore.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
What is it?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
You got yourself a ship.  We can leave as soon as you're ready.
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
I think she's going to be all right.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
No!...
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
How do you make him do that ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
I don't believe it !
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
So ?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I'm gonna miss you.
Com'on, just say it. Try it on for size.
Shhhh...!
You don't look very happy to see me.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
You used to dance...
What frequency ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Mr. Rasczak.
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
How bad are you, pal ?
Don't be a hero...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
To join, and become One with the Creator?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Programming ready?
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
<U>Computer off</U>!
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
'Commander' Decker?
Hold station.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Also -- there was nothing in your report about <U>why</U> you're here.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Not for us?
Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Evening, Annie.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
You like my play.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Hi.
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
<u>How</u>...?
Me?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Great.  Who is it...?
...yes.
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
What are you going to do?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
What, what what are you doing here?
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
Isn't he...
The prices are going up.
No, you're absolutely r...
I'm very sorry to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Nobody.
No.
But not that <u>way</u>...
You have to hide.
Will you help me out...?
...we had a script conference...
We're just talking about the...
This is Joe White.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
What?
...I...
...I know...I know...
Wally...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
I'm looking for the writer.
I...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
Grace...
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I don't getcha.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
Then you're finished in show business.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
You didn't see it...
I...
It's lovely.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
It's just a formality.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
I don't got the money.
Yeah?
Wally...?
Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  It's the Mayor, he's saying...
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
I've got two days to get this house...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
You hear that?
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
You think so?
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
We have to lose the window.
Why?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Scream.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I can't hear you.
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
You lost Ben?!
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I'm sorry, okay?  Let's not fi...
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
She still packing for her trip?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
That doesn't bother me.
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
Uh.  What is it?
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
No!  Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom.
You touched it.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?
Mommy?
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Ben where do you have to get to?
And when did that pass?
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
Which part of no don't you understand?
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
We...
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
What did you do?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
...in.
I have a snoop.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Jackie?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
You WHAT?
Oh, my God.
So.  Hopeful.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's the same choice you made.
My advice to you?  Don't die.
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician.
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
They're my kids.
I needed some time away.
Can we go sit somewhere?
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Where you goin'?
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Hey.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Who is Jesus?
But still, you can't be sure.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready!
Don't even joke about that!
Twinkeys!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
It's all about who you know.
Sure!...
Ready for tomorrow?
Well, I changed the ending a little.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Reconceive.
So? How was school today?
Dad?\85Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome.  Dad?\85Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hello, Vi.
You're not.
It's over there.
Fuck me hard!
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
That's good.
Yeah. But not any more.
Great. How old are they?
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I'll lead.
What do you mean?
Cooper...
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Well Filmore--
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I have a lighter!
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
How goes the roll call?
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
Possibly some coffee?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Yes?
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
Give that back to me.
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
But then, sir, why have you issued the order: Wing attack, Plan-R?
I suppose they are, sir.
How much soda, sir.
I'm trying to, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Where, sir?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
To peace on earth, Major.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Then there's no chance for recall?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
How long will it take to receive them all?
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Yes?
All right...we're still flying.  I'm taking her down to the deck.
Maximum ECM.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
They can't touch us at this height.
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
What's your point, Lothar?
What happened?
He's dead, all right.
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
That's the point.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Who's that?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Um-hm.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
That was really great.
Slides go with it.
Uh-huh.
Uh, home, you know.
It's really not about anything.
Sounds like a bummer.
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Don't let 'em fight.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
Yeah.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
Wait. Hey, man.
Hey, man.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Come on man.
Hey, man.
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Oh, you were in the band?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
It's safe, come on.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
You could do it.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Hi.
He is.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Erica.
Deep down. Way down.
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Um, mother-daughter.
Erica, you coming?
Two-fifty.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
What? What'd you do?
Well, w-what happened?
They let you out?
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
I don't know.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Was that supposed to be me?
Yes, you asshole.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. Jeff.
Come with me.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
To his hotel?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
No, it's not...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
You know, I've thought about that, actually.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Is that your driver?
You're not serious.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Yeah, come on, play it.
Alright, alright already.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Yeah.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Where's Erica? You seen her?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
What are you going to do? Hm?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Could you give me a ride?
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Another sex dream?
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Oh, thank G-d!  I'm not just super fat!
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Don't use big bills!
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ammo?
Hannah, we've...
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Is that you down there?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Really...
Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board.  Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
It's from hunger.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Hurt feelings department.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
It's just impossible.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
Oh, you --
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Look at this street.  All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Hers.
Her own movie theatre.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
Are you or aren't you?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Who else ?
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Cut away from me?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
The other guests?
What are the notes?
Go away.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Did she read the script?
Have one of mine.
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling?  Why are you so glum?
How did it go?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
You heard him.  I'm a star!
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
Uh-huh?
How is she?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it?
We've come for the car.
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
I lent it to a friend of mine. He took it up to Palm Springs.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
A Storm Dragon?
That little girl? Ha.  Now go on, get me some tools.
At last. Ultimate Power.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
Don't leave me.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let's talk about us, not her.
We can't do that.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
I'm not mad at you.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
A little.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse!
Guess! Go on.
Why the empty cage?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I give you a lift?
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I've been in love with you for years. Remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? And put your fingerprints on my lens.
Why didn't you tell me?
What are you making:
What's a tree?
She did that deliberately.
Lucy; come back!
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You're wasting your breath.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
What's it like?
Others?
Are you happy, Zaltar?
You look at them? How?
But it's impossible.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
You can use the wand.
What are you talkin' about?
Mr. Roebush?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Mr. Kent! Superman was here!
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
What kind?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
A television set?
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
When?
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
Everything.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
No, we're just going down.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Thank ...you.
There's no rush.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
I don't know you, lady.
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
How would you know?
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Yes! This time we got it right!
Hostages?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Actually, yes.
A "complimentary corsage."
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Oh Clark, no!
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
Gee. But --
Artemis? Do you read me?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
DELETE IN CUTTING
So --  I hope you like it.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Free!
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
So this is the planet Houston . . .
Look, they need a machine to fly.
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
And what do we get out of it?
Awesome!
I think he's kind of cute.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
What's he going to say?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
We'll all fry.
Destroy Superman!
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
I know, but  --
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Do you know where you're headed?
Keep warm now.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Not...gray.
Hey!
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're just jealous.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
See?
Mr. Romance...
Meteorites!
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
I don't understand.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What're you writing, Lois?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Who...who...
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
Can you really see through anything?
Where do you hail from?
I gave him steady employment --
I gave him this new face.
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Is that real enough for you?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Ally.  That's right.
We're...not together.
Yes...fine.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What are you thinking?
Yes.
Your kids never cry.
They can look forward to that.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
It's for the school bazaar.
We've only got honey.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
What happened to summer?
How was it?
So do you like your new room?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
Nicole?
I don't want you to lie.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I have no questions.
That's the local bar?
I'm in a car wash.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
Now on that morning, did there come a time, Nicole, when you left your parents' house?
I will offer that report.  Well, then, now that your memory seems to be clearing, can you tell us what else  you observed at that time?
Why were you scared?
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
Why not?
What's that?
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
What are you up to, Nicole?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
How?
He means that much to you...?
Susie, I like this new attitude of yours.  You're growing up and I like it!  I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward.  This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world.  Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Sidney, I told you -
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
Could this be that boy?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
But...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
I made you write a beautiful song...
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Do you have bandages?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
You will.
Alriight!!  My man!
Easy money!
Out of the way, John!
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You broke my arm!
Can it be destroyed?
The CPU from the first terminator.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow I can still see.  Look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do I have to --
It's not just a dream.  It's real, you moron! I know the date is happens!!
On Furtw\E4ngler.
And no elbows on the table!
What does he mean, too correct?
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Yes, David?
You bet.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtw\E4ngler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
I made no deal!
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I have illegitimate children.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
I've remembered something else...
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtw\E4ngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtw\E4ngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Oh! The evening before, I see...
You ever seen Adolf Hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? I've seen 'em on films.
Was looking at Furtw\E4ngler like that?
No, I was never a Nazi, I have no interest in politics, I'm a musician -
Aren't I worth waiting for?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Can you handle it?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
You can't to that...
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Alright, the beige one.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
You cold?
Reese...you got a first name?
Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
I caught one, back there.
What's he like?
Good field-dressing.
Bag some Z's?
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
What's that?
Not possible.
A girl.  You know.
And so you feel nothing.
I don't think I like this.
And who was the enemy?
...look, Lieutenant...uh, Vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Send a unit.
Call her.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
Admittedly...
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
I'm so sorry.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
I'm sorry, about this...
See you around.
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
There's a ladder here.
This is C.R.S.
Never did catch your name.
That's classic.
Nice.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Want anything to drink?
Take the picture out.
Who are "they?"
All I mean is... someone like you...
What?
Get us out of here...
They won't...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Hey there, Nickie.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
You need anything?
Call that number.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Tell me where we're going.
What's this all about, Connie?
It's them.  They did this.
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
V-A-N... O-R-T-O-N...  A gift from Conrad Van Orton. Interesting...
Physical?
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
You know, these fit... perfectly.
You did?  How is he?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Look... what I'm doing is none of your business...
Hey... !
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
Hi.  I'm Todd Aubochon.
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
It's not going to hold your weight.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
Well, this lot is full!
I didn't do it.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Nell!  What's wrong?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
What happened after you smelled it?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Welcome Home.
Someone is playing with you.
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
Come on.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
This is where we're going?
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
Why do you need a chain like that?
Is there something about the house?
Yes.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
Jeez.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
How could he have left without his keys?
David?
Is it over?
I've never had a pedicure before.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Am I a thing?
I'm not.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
We think someone is here.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
You should have let me do the talking.
Huh?
CQ what?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
Too easy?
Same.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Perhaps it was the smoke.
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
Modelling.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
I bet.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
I don't believe it.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Where is he now?
You sure?
I would have preferred staying home, me.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
How much.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What?
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
What's in it?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I miss my kids.
You must know Ian.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
Ann--
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Rachel.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...she can go up there.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Right! Strictly business.
All right.
How ya doin', Ed?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
...What kind of man *are* you?
What kind of man *are* you?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...What a knucklehead.
Dave.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Honey.
Yeah.
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Coffee, Ed?
...So, uh, who should I--
Ed, how're you holding up?
I don't work here. My wife does.
...Did you make that up?
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Frank.
...You ever wonder about it?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
...We goin'?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
He's a barber.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Behind you.
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
How big is the sub-basement?
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
What's that doing here?
What are we talking about here?
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
What's that?
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
What's that?
This room sucks.
Not that big.
Jesus, what is this?
What do you make of it, Margo?
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
That's not what I saw.
Genetic damage?
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Hide quickly!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Nothing was real.
I have a map.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I'm onto something, Marlon - something big.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
How did it go today?
Oh, God.
I know.
What did you want?
What do I do?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Let's go now.
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
It looks so small.
You got it.
Just listen.  You remember when you were a little boy, you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan--
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
What do you do?
I need your clothes, Byers.
Who?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Have you examined them?
You follow me out here for a reason?
My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil.
You a reporter?
And what's that?
He just let it explode.
Those people were already dead.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
I'll know soon enough.
A plague?
Negotiating with whom?
-- You saw this experiment?
You told me you had answers.
You didn't know my father --
I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic.
Scully...
They were the ones that put us together.
You're... quitting?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
Why are you whispering?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
You said you weren't coming?
He didn't mention a park.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
Been where?
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I have. I did. It's done.
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
Cold...
We've got to keep moving.
We're going to the morgue.
On whose orders?
General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Are we being watched?
You're lying.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Let me out. Stop the car.
More concerns than that?
We're going to tell them what we've found. What we've learned. Turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
He hates me.
She adores you.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I'd be there for him.
Is it cold in here?
Damn him.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
There's always a chance they'll confess.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
You think you can do this, don't you?
You sure about this?
Well look at that.
Who says?
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Catherine!
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
So?
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Thank you.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
...to steal my girl.
I wish I knew.
What happened to your hand?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...Headquarters.
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Must you take those letters? CALLOWAY Yes, I'm afraid so.
Joseph Harbin...
That's what we want to find out.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Thank you, you have been so kind. Anna moves down to stand CL of Paine.
Where?
How will I know you?
What is it?
...Austrian Police Headquarters.
My name is Calloway.
See much of him before that?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
...expense.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Get the next plane.
Well?
This is where he vanished.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
A girl of spirit.
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
Come upstairs a moment.
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
What's that?
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
Hello, Harry.
Hmm.
What do you want me to do?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
...the best way one can, you know.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
Speak English?
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
I was told that he did not die at once.
...give evidence.
You gotta tell your story to the police.
Oh, you did.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
What else did he tell you?
Third Man.
...this time.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
Everyone ok?
Richard - I saw a fin!
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
She is gone!
What about Moliere?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
But he has been there, off course.
One kilometer
Bonsoir.
Hi.
I think so too.
Exactly.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
Watch your language....
Fucking Danny, man...
Do we have to listen to this shit?
What do you care?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
What's he care about?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Who's Linda?
Where'd you get this?
It looks a little like a swastika.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
I don't know. I just want to try it.
No. What are you looking for?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I thought there were people here....
Who's Eichmann?
Why are you taking that?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
And Jewish men like to get it.
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Give me a reason not to.
I don't think you know what you are.
I thought you hated Torah.
It was a nine millimeter.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
How did you get the fucking number?
Don't tell me what I --
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
What is happening?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
Isn't it true?
Get out of here....
Which one were you aiming at?
Open it up.
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
That's all we've got left.
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
Mrs. Moebius.
If I went back to the lumberyard, the guy'd give me all the dynamite I wanted. Untraceable, you wouldn't -- need to...
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
What do you mean?
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Johana, am I boring you?
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
It can't be true!
Good afternoon.
You're right.  You're fired.
The Italian, I presume?
I tell you she's mine!
This is a great pleasure.
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
... It's a comfortable place.
Is it a poem?
Jacques!  Johana!
Checking out the competition.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Roberto?  How long?
What about the shoes?
Is he here?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
... What's your name again?
What's with the voice?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Why?
I don't have one.
Well, what are they?
It's okay.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
No, no!
Enzo?
Your mother?
Why?
... Everything.
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Don't you have a heater?
I recognize you.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
... No?
How can you tell it's a female?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Then, tell me a story.
I'm being a pain, huh?
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
And you?
What?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Assassin!
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
What were Italians doing living in Greece anyway?
How was your trip?
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Wait!  Professor...?
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
Please. Will you help me?
So. Do you have a name?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
Mr. Jefferson Carver?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
So, now what?
What was that!?
What!?
Mordechai?
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
What are you doing here?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Cool. What's it do?
What are you doing?
How do we bypass it?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
What are you doing?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
You okay?
What's going on? Why'd he stop?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Is he in love with you?
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
Sure.
I want him to lock me up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
What's left of him.
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
The death card - -
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life \97- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
It was you, Galbraith!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so \97\97
No \97- not yet.
Clo-Clo?
What did he have to do -\97 look at the body?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me \97\97
What else do you care about, Kicks?
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -\97 where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says \91closed to the public\92, doesn\92t it?
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
How dare you...  You don\92t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
Who is Friedman?
I\92m impressed. That information could have cost me \A320,000.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you\92d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you\92re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
You\92re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he\92d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don\92t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn\92t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
To get me killed...?
What do you suggest?
May I ask where you\92re from, Mr Lamont?
You\92re sure you won\92t sit down, Miss Stewart?
Okay. The woman just can\92t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can\92t you go to your Embassy?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy\92s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
What am I to do with the packages if...
Look, you don\92t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn\92t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who\92s the guy? The Austrian?
Friedman\92s dead... They killed him...
I\92m finished here and I\92m tired, Emily. You shouldn\92t be here. Now don\92t make it worse.
Then find another way.
I\92m calling about the puppies.
How much of a hurry are you in?
I\92m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
You\92re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Who are you?
Yes. Friedman\92s the fuckin\92 Austrian!
What company?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
\93La collectionoose\94. It\92s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It\92s on TV tonight and as I\92m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it\92s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director\92s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Hello there. How\92s the flat. I cleaned...
I\92d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can\92t, don\92t worry about it. I\92ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I\92m in a hurry. 
Must I speak to you in French?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
I didn\92t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
I\92m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
\A310,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Where is Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. You\92ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he\92s using?
It\92s about the puppy. You got the money?
What are you talking about?
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
He just said he had good reasons.
Yeah... But he didn\92t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent\92s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Is she on the phone?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon\92s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he\92d have found you before I did.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon\92s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Qu\92est-ce que tu veux?
Alors?
Three...
Why did you kill him?
So why didn\92t he?
What sums?
They lost their son. Why?
Mossad?
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
No, but...
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
We must sound the retreat!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I'm already free...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
But that was her order!
Didn't you also carry a banner?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
Trial?  What trial??
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What did it tell you?
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
So how would you put it?
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Wait, wait...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Who told you to wear men's clothes?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
How many did he give you?
I don't know... I thought...
What are you doing out here?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
My father's.
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I'm going to get a doctor.
How are you doing?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I need help.
How long have you been married?
What did I tell you?
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Don't be clever with me, Henryk. I've come here as a friend. They're bringing Jews in from all over the country. Soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. We need more Jewish police...
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
What's this about?
Boys, boys...
I know.
What did you pay him?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
How long have you been here?
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
Out of Warsaw.
You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
Where are you hiding?
I don't know how to thank you.
Szpilman.
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
What's he say?
Yes, why not.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
You have to wash them.
She wants to see what you can do.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
She wants it to come.
Hello, then.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Play a gig.
Mama.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
Yeh, go ahead.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
You got a bag or somethin?
Twist, you know this guy?
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't turn ya out if ya weren't ready.  I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I want you to look up.  There ain't a better insideman alive.  He'll teach ya everything ya gotta know.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I thought you blew all your money.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Mottola.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy we called him.  Runs a few protection rackets for Carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along.  Me and Danny been friends since we were six. Take a good look at that face, Floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in Chicago who'd like to do the same thing.  You understand what I'm sayin'?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
You just worry about your end, kid.
And?
You think he'll show?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
Henry.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
See and raise five.
Raise 300.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
My end was only one.
Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept... I'd like to ask you a few questions.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
It isn't any better.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Hooker!
What do you mean?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You really picked a winner, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
What's your next step, Nick?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
Any luck?
Oh, Andy.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
What is it?
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Don't.  It's horrible.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
I don't know.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
You can take that out to the car.
Shrapnel!
Did you kill her?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
Ask him.  I don't know.
What about Jorgensen?
Could this be him?
Are you kidding?
I said he hadn't written me.
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
I didn't know they had a fight.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
You did!
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
I know.
Chris!
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
We're just having a little drink.
Who's that man?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
You don't say --
I've done that already. He should appear, you know.  It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.
I have no right to answer that.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
I've never heard about you.
Why do you say that?
Who is she?
Who's that?
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
What are you going to do with it?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Good. I want to talk to you.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
There's one coming.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
He's just been for a walk.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
You bet I wouldn't.
Back to California
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Mimi!
Why are you saying it?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
Was he a good detective?
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Where are you going?
You speak English?  DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!?
What's in the other direction?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
Paper.
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
They shouldn't have been here.
This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
What are you doing.
He's not so--
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Missile!
What about it?
Stop it!
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Wes--
They'll kill you.  You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
You think?
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
It's going to be cool, Wes.  It's all all right.
Now this is war.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Take the binoculars.
They'll shoot us!
They're not going to--
She okay?
What?
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
It's a mine, isn't it?
I said nobody dies.  Nobody dies.
This.  Whatever it is.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
They're doing more than slapping.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
It's just a mongoose.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
No.
First Wes, now you?
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
What do you figure it is?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Slip out your M-16.
And then shoot them.
Is that good, or bad?
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
How do we do that?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
What is this?
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
You will.  You'll get it.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
I thought we were dead.
What do you think?
You down?
What the hell are you doing!?
I can't hear him.
Control ON.
When?
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
What time is it?
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
What's going on....what are you doing?
Who?  Who's leaving?
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Well?
Why did you have LUH come here?
What's going on?
Where's LUH?
...and you're not lost now?
Which way?
How do you know?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
...it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
That's not it.
Just look at all those people.
Yes
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
And you are...?
Coffee, Mike?
Where did you get this?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
How do you know?
Fuck factor?
Keep talking.
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Whadaya mean?
You got it.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
Lane oil...
What is that?
Drop it.
I want to work this.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
What about the ballistics report?
What the hell's going on?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Pooch, can you move it?
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
A what?
What?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No.
But--
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
He's really not a bad fellow.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
Thank you, Major. 
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Thank you!
Thank you, Baron.
Monescu!
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Right.
Five, seven, and nine--
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Yes.
Beautiful specimen.
Oh? 
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
The same thing.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Yes, Gaston?
Instantly.
Mariette!
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Adolph J. Giron.
Lovely.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
To me he seems rather nervous.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
But you're the more intelligent one.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
None of the stewards have seen her.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
We're too late.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
An accident?!
Something serious has happened.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You're a good liar.
You know somebody?
Cor... look at that, would ya.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
You're distracting me. Go away.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
It is that simple.
And these were drawn from life?
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
You have to go for help.
You jump, I jump, right?
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Yes sir.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Is your stateroom alright?
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
It's been 84 years...
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Rose, get in the boat!
Anya!
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
Aces full.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
Where have you been hiding?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
This is Mr.--er--
Isn't she attractive?
Don't rub it in.
When?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
A little.
What are you thinking?
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Oh, there you are--
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
I didn't--
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Very good, Mary--
--And he has sex appeal.
Get that out of your trunk.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Can you read 'em Jack?
How much did you lose?
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
There you are, sir.
I'll explain later--
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I'm sorry.  If there was any other-
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
You don't even know him.
How you feeling, Doc?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Not exactly...
Doc!  How the hell are you?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I'd ignore her.  People can Change, Doc.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Hey, is that "Old Dog Tray"? Sounds like "Old Dog Tray".
All right, I'm on fire!  Black Seven, seven stickin' spades. Let's go!
Maybe you ought to have a talk With Doc, Wyatt.  I don't know if He's gonna make it.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Yeah, better run, you bastards!
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
What is it?
Fun though, wasn't it?
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Wyatt!  My God...
Come up to the fire, honey.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Well how do we look?
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
It's that woman from the coach!
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Yeah?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
That a fact?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
How did you get this number?
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'd rather die alone.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Your new car. 
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
... Shoelaces?
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Where to now, Jimbo?
Married?
... Kids?
Have we met?
Boyfriend?
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Why don't we just take these -
You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
What the hell does that do?
Down?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
But if Elliot Harmsway is involved with that uranium, I want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Sakwa!
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
What's your name?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
That was too close.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Is the helicopter ready?
I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
Why does he always pick on me?
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
Who is it?
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Well, you just have to move further out.
Your feet are cold.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
What's the problem here?
I hope that it's nothing serious.
How is he doing?
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
How many people do you all feed?
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Can I bring some toys?
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
We're almost there.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
According to my nava-computer, the --
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
What happened to you?
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Hold on, Woody!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
I don't know!
Hey!!
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
Laser-envy.
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
What the heck is up there?
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
W-w-w-we?
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
He made that. In his off hours.
She's not accustomed to being ignored.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
Stop it!
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I'm Melanie.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
He's not here.
How much?
What is he planning on telling them?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Helena --
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
I think she's lying.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Oh, it is?
Where are you going?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
How's David?
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Live with your parents?
How are your grades?
What are you doing?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
Yes.
They're going to walk right past me.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
Can't you for a second imagine none of this had happened?  That my drugs had gone through.  What would have been the harm?  A few people get high who are getting high anyway. Your partner is still alive.  We avoid having breakfast together. Don't you see this means nothing? That your whole life is pointless?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
Fine, then we don't have deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Where are you going, Diane?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Yes.
Happy birthday.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Now remember --
But try too hard --
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
Running time?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
You know.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
Why?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
That's tough.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
The Sick Boy method.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
Sure.
How's it going with Gail?
Six weeks and no sex?
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
What do you see as your main strengths?
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Your pain runs deep.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
And that is?
Oh, God
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.
Oh. I believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Goodnight, Spock.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
Is it possible?
Spock... the booster rockets.
...mark two.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
What are you doing?
We must change our course at once.
No... I didn't.
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
No special conditions?
What have I done?


Borgus Frat.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Spock?
I don't understand...
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Hi, Alan.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
I want to go to his place.
They'll start to soon enough.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
This town's full o' live ones.
You said it.
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Alan!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Did we make it?
Hey... you guys OK?
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Watch it!
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
So...how's the world of serious science?
I'm afraid it's a little late for that. Dillinger's shut off Group 7 access. He must know what you're up to.
Wait...I need that...
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
How?
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
What's this for?
Thanks dear.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Fourteen, Harry.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Give me the page.
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
She's still at my house.						*
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers here in about 12 minutes. They're on maneuvers out of Boca Chica.
... well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  Just the basics... get away from windows, don't look at it... yeah--
He's got it.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Uh huh.  Okay.
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Not because you were attracted to him?
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Yes.
I think so.
Natasha?
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What were you doing there?
17 years.
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
Oh shit.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Beat it.
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
What?
Boris and Doris?
That was you?!
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
What's happened?
Not yet.
Has he looked through it yet?
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Sonny kicks ass.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Like it?
What kinda music do you like?
Four hundred bucks.
What's that?
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
I love Janis.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
That dazzling imagination.
You have a pimp?
A real live pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Why Cancoon?
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Wannabee nigger...
Clarence sent a letter?
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
Do you really mean it?
I'd fuck Elvis.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
I really don't know.
What do you want from me?
What makes you think I could do that?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
What are you talkin' about?
You and Robin moved?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Suspect's words -
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
What was I sayin'?
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
You gotta hold this for me.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Do you live here?
How do you know? You been there?
Yes.
Wake up, Cole.
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
My notes.  Observations.  Clues.
Does that disturb you, James?  Thinking about that little boy in the well?
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
See -- you can drive after all!
What made you think that?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Germs?!
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What....???
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Uh, that message...me?
But you know what's real now?
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
What?  What did you say?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
Where in Mexico would you like--
One way, or round trip?
Nope.  Darrell.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Hey!
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Taking a little trip?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Maybe I don't want you to.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Wasn't nothing.
It's nothing.  Really.
That a fact?
Thank you, John.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Least you can leave.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
A medicine man?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
I'm guessing no.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
John, please--
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Where's the safe?
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Let's do it here.
To get my car.
He was going to take the money.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
The trunk.  It's locked.
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Shut up.
Yeah, well, me too.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I wasn't doing anything.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Kids.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Nice night for a drive.  Morning really.  I guess that's about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Hell no!
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now, what's this?
I'm a solid man.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hey!
Talk?  About what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Harlin around?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Twenty-after-ten.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
Hundred-fifty.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
What the fuck did you do to my trunk?
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I like that about me, beautiful.
No, I've got it.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Where you coming from?
What happens when you lose?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
What's the matter?...Grace?
You'd never understand.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
What do you mean?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
The money's right here! Get the key!
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Hope is a four-letter word.
I busted my leg!
Why's that?
<u>Jake</u>...
What'd you say to me!
I need a ticket.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Let me get your change.
Morning Grace.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
...I can't remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Oh shit...
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
You've never been sick?
What's he talking about?
It's for last week's game.
I thought he was carrying something.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
I have to go now.
Quick.
Are you finished?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
I'm going to work out.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I'm sleeping in my room.
I'm not scared.
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
I'll just shoot him once.
Not really.
In the passenger car?
Did you get up from your seat?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Where'd you get the money, huh?
I didn't think they'd really do it.
He said...
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Oh. Yeah.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Yeah?
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
That much, huh?
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Like I said, I...
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
Ned's share?
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Finish him, Ned.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
When we gonna double back?
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
He's in there.
Yup.
Did... you... get... him?
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. You take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Three ways?
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
I seen him.
Worms was comin' out.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
What is it, son?
Hullo, paw.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
No... I meant...
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
Far enough.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
He's gonna die, ain't he?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Yeah.
There was ninety-one million -
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
They just said they wanted time.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I know who he is.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
He's alright.
Why don't you just calm down'
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.
I was out of line.
Three million?
What-are they speaking?
What if I
How are you, Keaton?
What about Redfoot?
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
He won't go into the interrogation room.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
I'11 find him.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
You keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t Keaton. It wasn't like that. Sure he knew, but Edie had him all turned around.                 r I'm telling you straight, I swear.                        +
You got him wrong.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Came from Redfoot.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
You're stalling, Verbal.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
I knew him. He would never -
You're not safe on your own.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
What did he find?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
How is that?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
You would not...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's all right, Mickey.
I am on the staff of...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I didn't do too well for you.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Who are you protecting, then?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I need an extension for my case.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Are you done?
I object, your Honor...
Exception!
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're pressuring yourself...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
Admittance form is wrong.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Are you with me...are you awake...?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
... I know.  I went ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
What happened in those three...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
That Frank was working on.  Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror.  So Franky finds out.  He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint.  I told him ' Franky, wake up.  These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from?  Doing good?'  He can't be comforted.  He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Just let me talk to you.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
Will you have dinner with me?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Mmm.
Tomorrow night? Well --
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
But I like that one, Scottie.
I don't like it!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
The color of your hair...
Can't you see?
We're going awfully far.
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
I'm scared.
We're going up the tower.
Yes!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
I made it.
Love me... keep me safe...
You don't remember.
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I hope we will, too.
Meet again, sometime.
And no birds sing.
What do you remember?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Where's your husband?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Go on.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
You believe that I love you?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Is there something I can do for you?
I had to quit, Midge.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Easy, now.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
Here you are.
Just wander.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
What have you been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
You're an asshole Adam.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
What did you say?
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
More.
What do you think you are doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
So that's what we're doing.
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
That's one idea.
No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said...  Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake.
Are you solid with that?
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
Have you thought about what I said?
Yup.
Is everything okay?
Your investment ideas never work out.
But not tonight.
What's goosed?
He's too drunk.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Call 911.
Nobody knows she's here.
Easy Boyd.
Boyd...What have we done?
I just want to get married.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
False.
Not true.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Easy Micheal.
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Are we supposed to?
These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day. Fisher do you take Liz to be your beloved wife, to respect, honor and cherish till death do you part?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Florist?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Don't you dare.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He just doesn't talk a lot.
Time out.
Do you love me?
You go down there.
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Yeah. Nesting.
What's the word on the chairs?
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
What are you talking about?
You fucked a prostitute?
You killed a prostitute.
Call the police.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Greenpeace.
Where's Boyd?
I guess.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
We will.
She's dead.
Fucking desert.
How long are you staying?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
What do you mean?
You must think I am a monster.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Is it all right?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Me?
Ramona! Ramona!
She isn't my cousin.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
Are they going to work here too?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
Why are you crying?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
Give me 30 seconds, then flip every switch you can reach.
What's the assignment?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
SID \97\97 NO!!!
What happened when he was 17?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
You're not capable of it.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go \97\97 right now.  Why are you going to do this?
My guess is dead.
Where the hell are you going?
What do we do now?
Where's John?
Do they have to look so...robotic?
...tonight...
What if he's busy tonight?
...on the way in.
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...

...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
Who we got here...?
Alright.  Look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  Tell'em what they need to know.
Don't you want to know if it's true?
What crisis?
It won't hold.
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
What is it?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.

We'll be back tonight.

ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
...where is my pill?
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.

Why do they go to War?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
Dartmouth
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.

You'll grow old.
He's lying.

Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus.  Jesus Christ, what are friends for?
What the hell...
The stock's going to Pluto!
Sell?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...Got a 100 on me, you...
That's great Dad.
What brings you out here...
...thanks Natalie.
Sure, and I'm never gonna die either, is this one of your chain letter schemes or do I gotta buy a door to door cosmetic franchise in Northern Arkansas?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
So what's the problem?
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
My home number's on the back...
Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
Weird and tiny huh?
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
Then why do you still like her?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Come on.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Well?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Of course you will.
That was very good.
I started seeing things.
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
What?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
How're you holding up?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Well maybe your wife...
Who?
Who are you?
That's not...It's not like that.
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Would you like some iced tea?
Mrs. Frank?
You look a little old for a student.
Why are you here?
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
We were suite mates.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Absolutely.
Seance.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
Does Norman know?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I'm a terrible friend.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Whatcha reading?
If you have to work...
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Wanna fool around?
Did you...
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Of what?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
I just wish you could have heard her.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Claire?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
Think I may have cracked it.
Yep.
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Sorry.  You understand.
Our house.
When?
...like it never even happened...
What are you doing out here?
How did you--
Sabotage?
The accident...?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
I'm sorry...
...I'm pulling up, Yuri.  I'll see you for dinner.  Sure you won't stay?
What?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
Claire, please don't...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
What?
Look for antiques...
I'm cooking you dinner.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
I have seen him again.  Last night.
There are two.
A what...?
Rowan.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
My...mother...?
Who the hel1 -
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
What is it...?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
Made it...?
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
A girl...?
Only you...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Oh god...
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
My jury's still out on that,
HARDER!
What else did you see- Michael...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Rowan...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Hi.
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
You okay...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Sugar?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What?
We've got nothing to talk about
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
Why did you let him in?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Don't you want me now LESLIE
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
Her husband left her
I thought it was you - how are you?
Dead?
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
ANGEL...
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Remember dress up day?  You and Charlie lifting skirts during recess.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
Finally, some gratitude.
Sorry I--
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
My new bike.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
I miss them, too.
That's a crappy thing to say.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
I don't get the distinction.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Don't write that part.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
It's all so complicated.
You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Tell me more.
Come on.
And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
But who would run the store?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
You called the cops on us?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Merritt, Forensics.
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
You okay?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
I don't know what to say...
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Where's the body?
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
That bothers you?
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
About a year ago.
Yeah.
No.
Yes.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
He did say something.
Why?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Are you crazy, Ray?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
I say something funny?
You are.
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
We have to stick with the plan.
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
Good thinking.
Forget it.
Where is she?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Sam, for godsake.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
J. S. Bach.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Limestone quarry?
That's a lot of butler.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Can you fill me in here?
Thank you.
This is good.
Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot."
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
It was in your book.
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
I admire a man with a sense of humor.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
You're not that big.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
The first.
Well?
Hey...!
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
You are very important, Willow.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
I can't.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Because it's true.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You a woodcutter?
What's that?  I hear something!
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
Here are her diaper rags.  And this is her milk bladder.  And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  She likes that.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Can't we keep it, Dada?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
What'd you bit me for!!
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Ohhh, I hate this.
This is not going well.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Tell you what \96 I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
What are you going to do?
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
What's your first move?
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Where are you taking us?
You have no right to keep us here.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Who are they?
How long have I been here?
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Where's the nearest telephone?
The... bullets?
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I was being foolish?
You're so sure of that?
Good morning.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
What's so funny?
No? Why not?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws \96
I will be the judge of that.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Momma... are they angry with us.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
No --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Yes.
From now on you'll be history
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...have you come back?
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Yes --
That's our farm!
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
...paper?
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh - I'll get it!
We might.
Oh! Something bit me, too!
Oh, my!
Who's her?  Who's her?
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
...don't talk.
...yes.
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
...free!
I don't blame you for that.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
The other side....
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
Oh --
Oh -- Oh --
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Dorothy next!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Oh, you did it yourself!
Here --   Come on.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
Yes, you.
That's right.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
I haven't slept in weeks.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
It's a whatzis.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
No, her dog!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
It's a whozis.
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.
...to Dorothy!
No, you don't.
Yeah --
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about us?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
-- Ruined my exit!
You new?
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Who\92s she?
The King pipeline.
Is there another way?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won\92t just be two weeks out of action.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I\92ve known that girl all her life. I\92m not sure she knows what she\92s walking into.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
They\92re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can\92t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
I haven\92t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
No!  It will cave in!
James...
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I\92ll take you home right now.
What are you talking about?
...what?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat\92s nest.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Really Bond, couldn\92t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
Now...where were we?
What?
I\92ll send someone out.
Perhaps this isn\92t the time...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn\92t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  It\92s what you wanted.
This is the end.
The parcel\92s in the post.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Had a lot of blood in him.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
A whore fucking.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
I could stay and go.
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
What -- am I --
Jon, where are we?
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
I\B9m not.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
. . . What?
Laurie --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
. . . That was quick.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
What happened?
What caused it?
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian.
He's a little farther gone every time.
What about you?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
New information.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Not bad for a gimp.
Up yours.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
But programmable. And expendable.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Whatchu doing here?
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Like what?
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Go to hell!
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
Where are we going?
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
What are you doing?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
This is your standard dart gun.
I think I'll hang on to these.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
What does that mean?
I wish I could go.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
How long have you been in Alaska?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
He's uptight.
He takes himself seriously.
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey.  A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him.  I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off.  You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.  But what you presume to tell this committee -
Dr. Grey.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
I do love a good check mate.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
The point of what?
How?
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
What did she do to me?
Is it enough?
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Is that so?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
Yes, sir.
What in God's name are you doing?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Surprised?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
Promise??
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
What?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
That's 'Fronkonsteen.'
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
Vermicelli.
But, sir...
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
Are you putting me on?
I thought you wanted to.
Home!
How?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Hmm!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Don't try to cheer me up that way.
Yes.
Yes, Master!
Where is he?
You don't understand, Master. The big fellow's broken in and kidnapped your fiancee.
How's everything?
MMMmmmmmm.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Are you busy?
Look, Doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
It wasn't me.
What are you going to do?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
His what??
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
How long is it so far?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
From the Cook, Sir They saw me dip your shaving tin in the tea-water this morning, made their tea taste of Lifebuoy toilet soap, they saij Handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier. 2t
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
